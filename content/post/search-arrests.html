<p>Police can search people they suspect of having prohibited items such as drugs or weapons. Since 2011, searches have decreased by 70%. Only 12% of searches lead to arrest, but this is increasing â€“ total arrests from searches have decreased only 38% since 2011, suggesting police are getting better at targeting offenders.</p>
