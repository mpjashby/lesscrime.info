<p>A combination of government-led changes to pay mean a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales in 2022 is paid about Â£7,600 less now than they would have been in 2010, once inflation is taken into account. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.</p>
