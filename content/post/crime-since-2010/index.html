<p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales is based on a large, representative sample of households. The survey measures crime in a consistent way that is not affected by changes in police recording of crime, so it can be used to reliably track changes in crime over time. Data from the Crime Suvey show that the proportion of people who say they or their household has been a victim of most common types of crime such as violence and burglary has dropped substantially since 2010.</p>
