<p>Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 yearsâ€™ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in 1987, only 25 people were a victim at least once in 2018. However, many of these crime types now appear to becoming slightly more common again.</p>
