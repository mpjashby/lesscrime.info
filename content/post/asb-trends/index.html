<p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people every year if they are worried about different types of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in the area where they live. For many types of ASB, in 2022 the percentage of people saying many types of ASB were a very/fairly big problem in their area was at or near its lowest level since records began in 2002.</p>
