<p>The government this week announced that almost 9,000 police officers had been recruited in England and Wales as part of a plan to increase police numbers by 20,000 by 2023. But in many parts of the country there are still fewer officers than a decade ago â€“ six forces have lost more than a fifth of officers compared to 2010.</p>
