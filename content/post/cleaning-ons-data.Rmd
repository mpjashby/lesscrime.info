TL; DR: [skip to the complete script](#complete)

The UK [Office for National Statistics](https://ons.gov.uk/) (ONS) publishes a 
lot of quantitative information on all the topics you'd expect from a national 
statistical office, but most of it is released in formats that need manual
cleaning before they can be used for data analysis.

[ONS has started publishing some machine-readable data]()[^3], but most products 
its produces are Excel tables that are optimised for human reading by mimicking 
the format of tables in the printed statistical reports that ONS produced for 
decades.

This tutorial talks through how to clean a human-readable table produced by ONS
using the `tidyverse` collection of packages, so the resulting [tidy 
data](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) can 
be used for analysis. As an example, we'll use a file containing [population 
estimates for each nation within the United Kingdom](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland) 
by five-year age groups.


# Why do this?

It might be tempting not to clean the data in R but instead simply open the
relevant file in Excel and make the necessary changes there. This will work, but
there are at least three reasons why cleaning the data in Excel is not 
necessarily a good idea.

  * *It's harder to repeat the process*. For example, if ONS updates the
    table (either because new data is available or to correct a problem) then
    you have to repeat the manual process in Excel. If you clean the data in R,
    typically all you have to do is run the script again.
  * *It's harder to find mistakes*. If you make a mistake while changing data in
    Excel but don't notice until later (e.g. if your results don't make sense)
    it will be difficult to track down exactly what happened. If you use a 
    script to clean the data, you can go back and run it line-by-line to 
    identify the problem.
  * *It's harder for others to trust your work*. If someone else wants to check
    your analysis (e.g. before taking action based on it), that's more difficult
    if you have manipulated the data manually in ways the other person cannot
    see.


# Before you start

This tutorial assumes you have [R](https://cloud.r-project.org) installed and
that you're comfortable with the basics of [using R to manipulate data ](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497143/business-intelligence-beginner-s-guide-to-r-introduction.html).
If you don't have the tidyverse collection of packages installed already, run
`install.packages("tidyverse")` before continuing. It also a good idea to run
this code from [inside a project](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).


# Download the data {#download}

Although ONS is relatively good at providing archive data, it's good practice to
always save an unamended copy of the raw data for any project just in case it
later disappears from the source website.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# download the data file
download.file(
  url = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland/mid20182019laboundaries/ukmidyearestimates20182019ladcodes.xls",
  destfile = "ons_pop_data.xls"
)
```


# Load the data into R {#load}

Since the data are in an Excel file, we can use the [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) 
package to read it into R[^2]. ONS publishes data using a mixture of file formats, 
including both the pre-2007 Excel `.xls` file format and the current `.xlsx` 
format[^1]. The `read_excel()` function can handle both `.xls` and `.xlsx` 
files, but can only load a single sheet from within an Excel workbook (i.e. 
file). We can use the `excel_sheets()` function to get the names of each sheet 
in the Excel file.

```{r}
library("readxl")
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
excel_sheets("ons_pop_data.xls")
```

Note that some of the sheets have a space at the end of the name, which will be
invisible when viewing the file in Excel but which we need to know about to
specify the sheet name for `read_excel()`.

The `Contents ` sheet contains a short description of the data in each of the
other sheets. There are blank rows between every row in this table (an example
of how ONS optimises for human rather than computer readability), but we can 
remove these rows using the `drop_na()` function from the `tidyr` package.

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
drop_na(read_excel("ons_pop_data.xls", sheet = "Contents "))
```

We're going to use the data from the mid-2018 UK population summary, so we want
the `MYE1` sheet. We can now use `read_excel()` to load the data.

```{r}
file_data <- read_excel("ons_pop_data.xls", sheet = "MYE1")
```


# Clean the data {#clean}

In Excel, the `MYE1` sheet looks like this:

![](/post/cleaning-ons-data/mye1-sheet-preview.png)

The `file_data` object contains the result of the `read_excel()` function's 
attempt to load this sheet into R:

```{r}
file_data
```

This isn't very useful. There are several problems we need to fix:

  1. the column names don't reflect the data in each column,
  2. all the columns have the type `<chr>` (character) even when the columns
     contain numbers,
  3. there are several blank or partially blank rows,
  4. the feedback questionnaire in the top-left corner of the sheet means
     `file_data` contains an extra column,
  5. there is a row containing a footnote,
  6. the data are in wide rather than long format.

We can fix all of these either using the parameters of `read_excel()` or  
functions from the tidyverse packages.

We can exclude all the cells in the sheet except those containing data with the
`range = ` parameter of `read_excel()`. We can either specify the cell range
manually (e.g. `range = "A5:H31"`) or we can use one of the `cell_*` collection
of helper functions from the `cellranger` package, which is loaded with 
`readxl`.

We can work out which cells we want to retain either by opening the file in
Excel and noting which rows contain the data, or by running `View(file_data)` in
R and then adjusting the value of `range =` in `read_excel()` until we are
happy with the result.

```{r}
file_data <- read_excel("ons_pop_data.xls",
  sheet = "MYE1",
  range = cell_rows(5:31)
)

file_data
```

This deals with the unwanted rows above and below the table, as well as the
unwanted columns produced because of the feedback questionnaire.

The next problem is that the column names represent the [GSS statistical
codes](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106185615/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/index.html) 
for the different nations of the UK, rather than the names of the nations. You 
may prefer the codes, but we'll assume that you want the names.

We can use functions from the `magrittr` package to work with individual values
in the data. All these functions are aliases for base R functions, but can be
easier to work with.

```{r}
library("magrittr")

# set a value for the first row in the first column, which is currently blank
file_data[1, 1] <- "group"

# replace the existing column names with the values from the first row
file_data <- set_colnames(file_data, file_data[1, ])

# remove the first row, which we no longer need, using slice() from dplyr
file_data <- slice(file_data, 2:n())

file_data
```

Next we remove any rows containing empty cells, since none of the data rows
contain empty cells (see [Tips](#tips), below, for tables where this isn't the
case). 

```{r}
file_data <- drop_na(file_data)

file_data
```

We can convert the data from wide to long using `gather()` from the `tidyr`
package. `gather()` can be a slightly confusing function to use, but there are
some useful tutorials available by [Garrett Grolemund](https://garrettgman.github.io/tidying/#gather), [UC Business Analytics](https://uc-r.github.io/tidyr#gather--function) and [R for Data
Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading-and-gathering).

```{r}
file_data <- gather(file_data, key = "geography", value = "population", -group)

file_data
```

Finally, we will neaten the data by converting the population variable to 
numeric and the geography variable to title case (using a function from the
`stringr` package).

```{r}
tidy_data <- mutate(
  file_data,
  geography = str_to_title(geography),
  population = as.numeric(population)
)

tidy_data
```


# A complete script {#complete}

Using the [`magrittr` pipe `%>%`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html), 
we can combine all these cleaning steps together, which makes the code more 
compact and (arguably) more readable.

```
library("lubridate") # lubridate and magrittr are part of the
library("magrittr") # tidyverse but not loaded with it by default
library("readxl")
library("tidyverse")

tidy_data <- read_excel("ons_pop_data.xls",
  sheet = "MYE1",
  range = cell_rows(5:31)
) %>%
  inset(1, 1, "group") %>%
  set_colnames(.[1, ]) %>%
  slice(2:n()) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  gather(key = "geography", value = "population", -group) %>%
  mutate(
    geography = str_to_title(geography),
    population = as.numeric(population)
  )

```


# Tips for other ONS tables {#tips}

There is a huge number of ONS tables available, some having different formatting
issues from those mentioned above. These are some of the issues I've come across
and potential ways to deal with them.

(The examples below all assume your data is in a data frame/tibble called 
`data`.)


## Missing values in the data

Many ONS datasets have missing values, and some even have multiple 
values representing different reasons for the values being missing. For example,
data for small geographic areas might be missing because the data could not be
collected for a particular location or have been redacted to prevent disclosure
of personal information.

The `na = ` parameter of `read_excel()` can be used to specify values in the
data that should be treated as missing. For example, if an ONS table uses a
blank cell to represent data that could not be collected and `**` to represent
redacted data, `read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet 1", na = c("", "**"))`
will ensure both values are represented by `NA` in R.

It isn't possible to use `drop_na()` to remove empty rows if there are missing 
values in the data, because `drop_na()` removes rows that contain *any* missing
values. Instead, you can use `remove_empty()` from the `janitor` package to 
remove rows or columns that are entirely empty. If there are rows that you want
to remove from the data that contain some missing values and some values that
are not missing, use `filter()` from `dplyr` based on the value of a specific
column. For example, to remove rows with the value of `population` missing,
use `filter(data, !is.na(population))`. To remove single rows manually by row 
number, use `slice()`, also from `dplyr`.


## Multiple tables in a single sheet

Sometimes multiple related data tables are placed on a single Excel sheet. You
can either import them separately and then combine the resulting datasets 
manually (e.g. with `rbind()`) or just treat the rows or columns between each
table as clutter that can be removed using a combination of `drop_na()` and 
`slice()` as above. In the latter case, modify the `range = ` argument of 
`read_excel()` so that the selected cells/rows/columns include all the tables.


## Category names or values with footnote markers

If tables have multiple footnotes, some categories or values may end in a
footnote marker (typically a number). To remove these, use `str_remove()` from
`stringr`. For example, if the column `place` contains values with footnote
markers, you can use `mutate(data, place = str_remove(place, "\\d+$"))` to 
remove them, where `\\d+` is a [regular expression that matches one or more 
numeric characters](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html#matching-multiple-characters)
and [`$` matches only numeric characters at the end of the
value](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html#anchors) 
of `place`. This only works for non-numeric values with numeric footnote 
markers, since the regular expression `\\d+$` will match any sequence of numbers 
at the end of a cell.


## Dates and date ranges stored as text

Since many ONS statistics are published for financial years, time periods are
often stored as strings showing, for example, `2018-19`. Converting these to
dates helps with things like plotting values on an axis with date values or
using the data in a time-series model.

The `lubridate` package is very useful for converting dates. You can either
represent each date as a specific moment in time, or as an interval in time.
For example, if a financial year is stored as `2018-19` in the `year` column,
you can extract the specific moment the year started using
`mutate(year_beginning = ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4)), "04", "01"))`. In this
code, `str_sub(year, 0, 4)` extracts the first four characters from the string
`2018-19`, `paste()` creates a single character value for 1 April in the given
year (e.g. `2018 04 01`) and `ymd()` converts that string into a date object.

To store a date as an interval, we extract both the date on which the year 
started and the date it ended. For example,

```{r eval=FALSE}
mutate(
  data,
  year_interval = interval(
    ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4), "04", "01")),
    ymd(paste(str_sub(year, -2), "03", "31"))
  )
)
```


## R session information

The code in this tutorial was run in R with the following configuration:

```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

[^1]: I have not been able to work out why some ONS files are in `.xls` format
and some in `.xlsx`.

[^2]: The `readxl` package is [installed as part of the 
tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) but is not automatically loaded 
by `library("tidyverse")`.

[^3]: ONS refers to this as 'open data', although (almost) all the products it 
produces are already [open licensed under the Open Government
Licence](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences)
