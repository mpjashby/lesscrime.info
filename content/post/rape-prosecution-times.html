<p>The time taken for a typical rape case to be prosecuted in court increased only slightly from 2012 to 2018, but the time taken for police to investigate rapes and the CPS to decide whether to charge a suspect has more than doubled. The government has not published updated data since March 2019.</p>

<p>There are several potential reasons for this increase, which could explain it
either individually or in combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuts to police resources may have led to longer investigation times.</li>
<li>Cuts to CPS resources may have led to longer delays in making the decision
whether or not to charge the suspect.</li>
<li>Attempts to increase the proportion of rapes reported to police may mean
more rape investigations need extended inquiries.</li>
<li>Developments in investigative techniques (e.g.Â analysis of mobile-phone
data) or changes in offence circumstances may mean investigations take
longer.</li>
</ul>
