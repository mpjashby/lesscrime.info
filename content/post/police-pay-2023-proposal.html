<p>The Home Office has proposed a 3.5% increase in police pay for 2023. If that were applied equally across all pay points, it would mean that a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales would be paid about £9,500 less in 2023 than they would have been in 2010 once inflation is taken into account – a real-terms reduction of 26%. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.</p>
