<p>Most people convicted of a crime will not be convicted or cautioned for another offence within 12 months, although young offenders are more likely to offend again than adults. Most re-offending is by a small number of prolific offenders who frequently pass through the criminal justice system â€“ more than 60% of people released from short prison sentences will reoffend within a year.</p>
