I needed to make maps showing the locations of the various Basic Command Units in the Metropolitan Police Service in London. I didn't have anywhere specific to put these, but they might conceivably be useful for other people, so I've put the maps below. The [code to make these maps is on Gist](https://gist.github.com/mpjashby/7485de3f8fc0565abf0dfec61b025550).

Feel free to use these maps in any projects -- see the bottom of the page for a link to the Creative Commons Attribution licence.
