abstract = "Despite growing interest in the UK and internationally in child sexual exploitation (CSE), policy-makers, practitioners, researchers and the media have tended to focus primarily on female victims. Consequently, the sexual exploitation of young males has been largely overlooked: remarkably little is known about this group, their experiences, vulnerabilities or support needs. The purpose of this document is to provide a brief synthesis of key findings from recent exploratory research on the sexual exploitation of young males in the UK."
