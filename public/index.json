In the same dataset, ONS publishes an overall estimate of the severity of crime per capita in each police force area. To convert this to an estimate of crime severity per officer (referred to above as crime pressure), severity per capita was multiplied by police force area population1 and then divided by the number of full-time equivalent police officers in each force. Crime pressure is therefore defined as the severity of police-recorded crime per full-time equivalent officer.\nEstimates of the severity of different crimes are inherently limited, although they are likely to be more informative for some purposes than simply counting crimes (which implicitly assumes all crimes are of equal importance). For a further discussion of this, see Comparing methods for measuring crime harm/severity.\n  Police force area populations were calculated by aggregating mid-year population estimates for local authorities to police force areas using the ONS open geography portal local authority to police force lookup table.↩︎\n   ","date":1660780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660780800,"objectID":"f1dde95bc3b3f1af64609c8a88662a1f","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/post/crime-pressure-force-2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/crime-pressure-force-2022/","section":"post","summary":"One way to understand crime-related demands on police forces is to track ‘crime pressure’, a measure of investigative workload representing the number of crimes reported to a force per officer, weighted according to Office for National Statistics estimates of the relative severity of different crimes.","tags":["crime","crime pressure","crime severity","police"],"title":"Increases in crime-related demand are hitting some forces harder than others","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Crime and justice chart of the week"],"content":" The government is reversing its earlier cuts to police numbers, but population increases mean that despite 13,800 extra posts over the past two years, the number of officers per 100,000 people now is still at levels not seen (before austerity) since 1980.

Problem-oriented policing (POP) and evidence-based policing (EBP) are two popular and enduring reform efforts, both of which have generated significant researcher and practitioner attention. There are important similarities between POP and EBP: both approaches provide a framework intended to improve the outcomes of policing. There are also key differences, however, in terms of their main objectives, standards of evidence and units of analysis. Despite both approaches being widely advocated and implemented, presently little is known about police practitioner understanding of the relationship between POP and EBP, both in principle and in practice. To address this gap, this paper draws on survey (n = 4,141) and interview (n = 86) data collected from 19 police forces in England and Wales in 2019 to explore police practitioners’ views on the relationship between POP and EBP, and the extent to which these two approaches inform contemporary police practices. Our findings indicate that respondents generally viewed the two approaches as complementary and important frameworks for orienting police work. However, respondents also drew attention to how the two approaches are not always connected organisationally nor in the minds of police personnel. In addition, challenges were identified in the application of both approaches in practice. Our results suggest that more needs to be done to maximise the potential of POP and EBP, both separately and synergistically. The article concludes by suggesting some ways in which this might be achieved.","tags":[],"title":"Police perceptions of problem-oriented policing and evidence-based policing: evidence from England and Wales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K Bullock","A Sidebottom","R Armitage","Matt Ashby","C Clemmow","S Kirby","G Laycock","N Tilley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639958400,"objectID":"d942a55f5c602a74068bceb4877c95cd","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/40-years-of-pop/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/40-years-of-pop/","section":"publication","summary":"This article analyses and critically reflects on the position of problem-oriented policing within England and Wales. Problem-oriented policing is a framework for improving police effectiveness. Its adoption has consistently been shown to be associated with sizable reductions in a wide range of crimes and public safety issues. However, many studies also find that problem-oriented policing is difficult to embed and sustain within police organisations. This article draws on the experiences and perspectives of 86 informed stakeholders to critically examine the position and practice of problem-oriented policing 40 years after its original formulation by Herman Goldstein in 1979. We argue that despite evidence of renewed interest in problem-oriented policing, the approach is not habitually conducted within police organisations in England and Wales. Where it is conducted, the practice of problem-oriented policing is found to lack discipline, the processes tend not to be faithfully followed, and there are weaknesses at all stages of the process. Implications of the findings for future research and police practice are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Forty years of problem-oriented policing: A review of progress in England and Wales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matt Ashby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638748800,"objectID":"bd5933464ddef8fea4d587f3b3791f89","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/stop-and-search-london-2021-q3/","publishdate":"2021-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stop-and-search-london-2021-q3/","section":"publication","summary":"*Stop and Search in London* reports summarise how police in London are using their stop-and-search powers.

Drawing on surveys of (n = 4141) and interviews with (n = 86) police personnel from 19 police forces in England and Wales, we identify five key barriers and facilitators to problem-oriented policing: leadership and governance, capacity, organisational structures and infrastructure, partnership working and organisational culture. These factors provide important indicators for what police organisations need to do, or need to avoid, if they are to successfully embed and deliver problem-oriented policing. The article generates critical information about the processes that drive change in police organisations and offers recommendations for police managers who may wish to implement or develop problem-oriented policing.

In the same dataset, ONS publishes an overall estimate of the severity of crime per capita in each police force area. To convert this to an estimate of crime severity per officer (referred to above as crime pressure), severity per capita was multiplied by police force area population1 and then divided by the number of full-time equivalent police officers in each force. Crime pressure is therefore defined as the severity of police-recorded crime per full-time equivalent officer.\nEstimates of the severity of different crimes are inherently limited, although they are likely to be more informative for some purposes than simply counting crimes (which implicitly assumes all crimes are of equal importance). For a further discussion of this, see Comparing methods for measuring crime harm/severity.\n  Police force area populations were calculated by aggregating mid-year population estimates for local authorities to police force areas using the ONS open geography portal local authority to police force lookup table.↩︎\n   ","date":1626652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626652800,"objectID":"c0b8fcbafdd0498529dd0e269c637533","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/post/crime-pressure-force/","publishdate":"2021-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/crime-pressure-force/","section":"post","summary":"One way to understand crime-related demands on police forces is to track ‘crime pressure’, a measure of investigative workload representing the number of crimes reported to a force per officer, weighted according to Office for National Statistics estimates of the relative severity of different crimes.","tags":["crime","crime pressure","crime severity","police"],"title":"Increases in crime-related demand are hitting some forces harder than others","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Crime and justice chart of the week"],"content":"  The government this week announced that almost 9,000 police officers had been recruited in England and Wales as part of a plan to increase police numbers by 20,000 by 2023.

Attempts to increase the proportion of rapes reported to police may mean more rape investigations need extended inquiries.

Although the report contained lots of information, it was probably inevitable that people would focus on the figures for disparities in stop and search rates between ethnic groups. This has led several people to ask how I calculated these disparities, so I’ll set that out in this tutorial.\nPrepare the data First, we load the tidyverse R package, which contains various functions for handling data and the scales package for formatting numbers.\nlibrary(\u0026quot;scales\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) To calculate search rates we need data on searches and data on population. The holy grail of population data would be an accurate representation of the number of people available to be searched in a particular place, since a person in a public place is vastly more likely to be searched in relative terms than someone sitting watching TV in their kitchen. Unfortunately, this data doesn’t exist, so we have to rely on residential population data. As I discuss in the report, this is not perfect, but it is probably acceptable if we calculate search rates for London as a whole, rather than particular neighbourhoods.\nSearch data is available from data.police.uk but is unfortunately stuck behind a web form, meaning it is difficult to download directly within an R script. I’ve instead downloaded the stop-and-search data for the Metropolitan Police for July to September 2020. This is slightly different to the data I used for the report, which also included stops by the City of London Police and British Transport Police in London, but almost all searches in London are done by the Met, so this is unlikely to affect the results much 1.\n# you can download a copy of the data file I downloaded from data.police.uk # from https://github.com/mpjashby/lesscrime.info/raw/master/public/post/met_stop_and_search_data_july_to_september_2020.zip # the search data comes in a ZIP archive, so we will unzip to a temporary # directory and then read it from there unzip( zipfile = \u0026quot;met_stop_and_search_data_july_to_september_2020.zip\u0026quot;, exdir = str_glue(\u0026quot;{tempdir()}/stop-search-data/\u0026quot;) ) # now read all the CSV files from the temporary directory and combine them into # a single data frame searches \u0026lt;- str_glue(\u0026quot;{tempdir()}/stop-search-data/\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% dir(pattern = \u0026quot;csv$\u0026quot;, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% map(read_csv) %\u0026gt;% bind_rows() %\u0026gt;% # convert the column names to be easier to work with in R code janitor::clean_names() # select only the columns we need searches \u0026lt;- select(searches, type, gender, age_range, self_defined_ethnicity) This gives us a data frame where each row represents a stop and search of one person or vehicle.

These are only estimates, but are probably the best figures available because the latest census data are now nearly a decade out of date.

Before we can do this, we need to:\n rename some columns and the values of the ‘sex’ variable so they match those in the population data, aggregate ethnic groups into the categories ‘Asian’, ‘Black’, ‘Mixed’, ‘Other’ and ‘White’, since the number of searches in some of the smaller ethnic groups is too low to draw conclusions from, remove searches of unattended vehicles (or attended vehicles where no people were searched), since we don’t have age, sex and ethnicity data for those, remove searches for which one or more of age, sex and ethnicity are missing, or where sex is listed as ‘other’ since there is no population data for this group.  search_counts \u0026lt;- searches %\u0026gt;% # rename columns so they match the population data rename(sex = gender, ethnic_group = self_defined_ethnicity) %\u0026gt;% # change sex to lower case mutate(sex = str_to_lower(sex)) %\u0026gt;% # aggregate ethnic groups by taking the first word (\u0026#39;White\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Black\u0026#39; etc) from # each group name mutate(ethnic_group = str_extract(ethnic_group, \u0026quot;^\\\\w+\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% filter( # filter out vehicle-only searches type %in% c(\u0026quot;Person search\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Person and Vehicle search\u0026quot;), # filter out rows with missing, age, sex or ethnicity !is.na(age_range), !is.na(ethnic_group), sex %in% c(\u0026quot;female\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;male\u0026quot;) ) %\u0026gt;% # count searches in each category count(sex, age_range, ethnic_group, name = \u0026quot;searches\u0026quot;) We must also count the number of people in each population group, since in the raw data there is a separate row for each individual year of age.

Note, however, that some demographic groups have very small numbers of searches so the calculated rates are likely to be unstable. To deal with this, we will only calculate rates for groups for which there were at least 100 searches between July and September 2020. We will also exclude the ‘Other’ ethnicity category, because it covers such a broad range of different people that it is difficult to interpret the results.\noverall_rate \u0026lt;- sum(counts$searches) / (sum(counts$people) / 1000) group_rates \u0026lt;- counts %\u0026gt;% filter(ethnic_group != \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;, searches \u0026gt;= 100) %\u0026gt;% mutate(search_rate = searches / (people / 1000)) We could show these values as a table, but there would probably be too much information to easily digest.

Nevertheless they are similar overall, and in particular the ordering of the groups from highest to lowest is almost identical.\n Calculating age- and sex-standardised disparity ratios For some purposes, comparing specific age/sex/ethnicity groups to the population as a whole may not be of interest. For example, we might be interested in comparing people in non-white ethnic groups to white people of the same age and sex. To do this, we have to arrange our data frame into a different format so we can divide the search rate for each group by the corresponding rate for white people.\nstandardised_disparity \u0026lt;- group_disparity %\u0026gt;% # remove columns we don\u0026#39;t need, which makes pivot_wider() work more easily select(-searches, -people, -disparity) %\u0026gt;% # make our data \u0026#39;wider\u0026#39;, so we can divide one column by another # for an explanation of long vs wide data, see # https://sejdemyr.github.io/r-tutorials/basics/wide-and-long/ pivot_wider(names_from = ethnic_group, values_from = search_rate) %\u0026gt;% # divide each search rate by the corresponding search rate for white people mutate( across(where(is.numeric), ~ . / White, .names = \u0026quot;{.col}_disparity\u0026quot;) ) %\u0026gt;% # convert the data back to \u0026#39;long\u0026#39; format pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), values_to = \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # further convert the data to a semi-wide format, so that each row represents # one demographic group, as in the original data separate(name, into = c(\u0026quot;ethnic_group\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cat\u0026quot;), fill = \u0026quot;right\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% replace_na(list(cat = \u0026quot;search_rate\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = \u0026quot;cat\u0026quot;) We can visualise these standardised disparities.\nggplot( standardised_disparity, aes( x = ethnic_group, # show age groups in natural order y = fct_rev(fct_relevel(age_range, \u0026quot;10-17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;18-24\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;25-34\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;over 34\u0026quot;)), # set text colour so it is visible over the background fill colour = disparity \u0026gt; diff(range(disparity, na.rm = TRUE)) / 2, fill = replace_na(disparity, 0), # format number for printing label = replace_na(number(disparity, accuracy = 0.01), \u0026quot;–\u0026quot;) ) ) + geom_raster() + geom_text(na.rm = TRUE) + scale_x_discrete(position = \u0026quot;top\u0026quot;) + scale_colour_manual(values = c(`TRUE` = \u0026quot;grey90\u0026quot;, `FALSE` = \u0026quot;grey10\u0026quot;)) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;darkblue\u0026quot;) + facet_grid(cols = vars(sex)) + labs( title = \u0026quot;Standardised stop-and-search disparity ratios\u0026quot;, subtitle = \u0026quot;Rate of search rates for each group relative to white people of the same age and sex\u0026quot;, x = NULL, y = NULL ) + theme_minimal() + theme( axis.text = element_text(size = 10), legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;, panel.grid = element_blank(), plot.title.position = \u0026quot;plot\u0026quot;, strip.placement = \u0026quot;outside\u0026quot;, strip.text = element_text(face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, size = 10) ) Comparing every group to every other group I’ve had a request to calculate disparity ratios for every group in comparison to every other group.

They are by no means perfect, since different people (and groups) might experience the same treatment in different ways for all sorts of reasons. Disparity ratios also do not explain why different groups are searched at different rates. I discuss these issues in more detail in the report, which you can download to read for free.\n   Adding in data from British Transport Police would mean we needed to remove searches conducted by BTP outside London, because they cover the whole of Great Britain. This has to be done using a spatial join, which would make this tutorial quite a lot longer.↩︎\n   ","date":1607558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607558400,"objectID":"5e3c7983820ab5a0f7548d22a7ce8526","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/post/calculating-disparities-in-stop-and-search/","publishdate":"2020-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/calculating-disparities-in-stop-and-search/","section":"post","summary":"I recently published a report on how stop and search is used in London.

This disadvantages researchers in the global south, policy makers and practitioners who have the skills to use research findings but do not have journal subscriptions. Open access seeks to increase availability of research, but take-up among criminologists has been low.\nThis study used a sample of 12,541 articles published in criminology journals between 2017 and 2019 to estimate the proportion of articles available via different types of open access. Overall 22% of research was available to non-subscribers, about half that found in other disciplines, even though authors had the right to make articles open without payment in at least 95% of cases. Open access was even less common in many leading journals and among researchers in the United States.\nOpen access has the potential to increase access to research for those outside academia, but few scholars exercise their existing rights to distribute freely the submitted or accepted versions of their articles online. Policies to incentivise authors to make research open access where possible are needed unlock the benefits of greater access to criminological research.","tags":[],"title":"The open-access availability of criminological research to practitioners and policy makers","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1603152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603152000,"objectID":"a2258ae89e5a838365eeb2631095cb1e","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/talk/npcc-hotspots/","publishdate":"2020-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/npcc-hotspots/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Hot spots: how they form and ways to analyse them","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This post first appeared on the #CrimComm Blog\nYou’re a criminal-justice researcher and you’ve just published an article in a top journal. It was a lot of work: you spent months securing ethical approval, collecting data or negotiating access to secondary data, completing the analysis, writing up the results and responding to reviews. You are rightly proud of the result. But – by default and without meaning to – you have probably locked your paper away behind a journal paywall so that many potential readers simply can’t see it.\nWhile researchers at universities in western countries typically have electronic access to journals, many others who could benefit from criminal-justice research do not. Universities in developing countries may have very few library resources, while access to journals in police and local-government agencies is typically extremely limited, meaning the increasing band of criminal-justice pracademics (who want to make use of research and have the skills to do so) are often left in the dark.\nThe lack of public access to criminal-justice research is particularly worrying because so much of it is relevant to practitioners and policy makers. Imagine a police captain who wants to know what effects the introduction of body-worn cameras is likely to have, or who has to decide whether to authorize a a ‘scared straight’ program suggested by one of her officers. Not having access to good-quality research could easily lead to decisions that harm public safety or waste scarce resources.\nFortunately, you almost certainly have the right to release a version of your paper online for anyone to read, completely free. This is referred to as self-archiving or as green open access, to distinguish it from gold open access in which authors pay an article processing charge (APC) to make the article free on the journal website.\nAll the main publishers of criminology journals allow authors to post the pre-print or submitted version of an article (the version originally submitted to the journal) on authors' personal and university websites, as well as specialist websites known as pre-print servers. Most publishers also allow authors to post the post-print or accepted version (the final version submitted to the journal after any revisions), although sometimes with more restrictions. As part of their open-access policies, publishers also do not consider self-archiving of pre- or post-prints as prior publication. There are other benefits to self-archiving, too: releasing a pre-print is associated with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article.\nEven though authors can release their articles online, recent research shows only about a quarter of articles in criminology journals are open access (either green or gold). This means that in the past three years, over 9,000 criminology articles that could have been open to the public were instead locked away.\nYou might be worried about releasing your article publicly before it has been peer reviewed. What if you\u0026rsquo;ve made a mistake? You can decide not to post the submitted version online, choosing instead to post the accepted version once it is available. But doing this means your research stays hidden during the review and revision process. If a practitioner needs to make a decision now about a policy or practice, they may prefer to have access to your research (perhaps with a note explaining it has not yet been reviewed) rather than have to make the decision blind, only to see your research released a few months later when it no longer matters to them. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth remembering that the peer-review process is not perfect. Many mistakes (and worse) have been published despite being read by multiple reviewers, so authors should not treat peer review as the only determinant of research quality. I post both the submitted and accepted versions of my articles, trusting readers to understand that all research should be read critically.\nThe easiest way to discover your self-archiving rights under a particular journal policy is to search the Sherpa Romeo database, which summarizes policies from more than 4,000 publishers. Take the journal Policing, published by Oxford University Press. Searching on Sherpa Romeo shows:\n   Screenshot of the webpage https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/publication/687  In this case you can:\n post the submitted (pre-print) version on your own website, an \u0026lsquo;institutional repository\u0026rsquo; (your university website) or a \u0026lsquo;subject repository\u0026rsquo; (a pre-print server), post the accepted (post-print) version on your university website or a pre-print repository, but only 24 months after publication (known as an embargo period).  In both cases, once the article is published you must add a note to the pre-/post-print linking to the published version.\nWhen it comes to the question of where to post your paper, remember the objective is to get your research into the hands of those who need it. The more widely you distribute your article, the easier it will be for people to find. I post my papers on my own website, the institutional repository run by my university and a pre-print server called SocArXiv that hosts papers from across the social sciences. Other options include Academia.edu and ResearchGate, although there are reasons you might not want to use them. I use SocArXiv because it is indexed by search engines such as Google Scholar. SocArXiv (and some other pre-print servers) also assign a digital object identifier (DOI) to your article, making it easier for people to cite it even before the final version is published. Posting an article on a pre-print server is straightforward and usually takes only a few minutes.\nWhen posting your paper online, you will be asked to choose a license under which people can re-use it. By default, you own the copyright to any work you post online, but this may restrict others from using your paper by (for example) sending it to a mailing list or hosting a copy for students on their university online learning portal. You can make it easier for people to share your content with others by using an open license, which gives people re-use rights. For example, the Creative Commons Attribution License allows people to re-use your work for any purpose, as long as they cite you as the author.\nSelf archiving can be useful even if you intend to eventually publish your article using gold open access. Gold open access makes it very easy for readers to find an article, but it is only available to authors (or institutions) who can afford the high prices of APCs. Gold open access also keeps research hidden throughout the peer-review and publishing process. If you plan to make your article gold open access by paying an APC, consider also posting the pre-print version of the article at the time you submit to the journal. If you are a research leader, be it a doctoral adviser or a head of department, you can also encourage self-archiving by establishing it as the norm among your team.\nOpen-access publishing isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to ensure your article has an impact among practitioners. You can also present your work at practitioner conferences, publish summaries of the results in practitioner-focused magazines or websites, discuss your findings on social media or host a webinar. But self archiving to make your work available to practitioners and other readers who don\u0026rsquo;t have access to journal subscriptions is a great first step.\nThanks to Dr Lily Gleicher and Prof Peter Moskos for their comments on an earlier draft of this post.\n","date":1596585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596585600,"objectID":"b6e62c6b565d01e28fbb52308b5750eb","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/post/how-to-stop-hiding-your-research/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-stop-hiding-your-research/","section":"post","summary":"This post first appeared on the #CrimComm Blog\nYou’re a criminal-justice researcher and you’ve just published an article in a top journal.

Several contingency plans warned police to expect a large and potentially overwhelming increase in demand from the public during a pandemic, but (to the author’s knowledge) there is no empirical work on police demand during a major public health emergency. This study used calls-for-service data from 10 large cities in the USA to analyse how calls for service changed during the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, compared to forecasts of call volume based on data from previous years. Contrary to previous warnings, overall the number of calls went down during the early weeks of the pandemic. There were substantial reductions in specific call types, such as traffic collisions, and significant increases in others, such as calls to dead bodies. Other types of calls, particularly those relating to crime and order maintenance, continued largely as before. Changes in the frequency of different call types present challenges to law enforcement agencies, particularly since many will themselves be suffering from reduced staffing due to the pandemic. Understanding changes to calls in detail will allow police leaders to put in place evidence-based plans to ensure they can continue to serve the public.","tags":[],"title":"Changes in Police Calls for Service During the Early Months of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589760000,"objectID":"19528c14dcdd59702760df5d6dd7c5c5","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/coronavirus-and-crime/","publishdate":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coronavirus-and-crime/","section":"publication","summary":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial changes in the daily activities of millions of Americans, with many businesses and schools closed, public events cancelled and states introducing stay-at-home orders. This article used police-recorded open crime data to understand how the frequency of common types of crime changed in 16 large cities across the United States in the early months of 2020. Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of crime in previous years were used to forecast the expected frequency of crime in 2020 in the absence of the pandemic. The forecasts from these models were then compared to the actual frequency of crime during the early months of the pandemic. There were no significant changes in the frequency of serious assaults in public or (contrary to the concerns of policy makers) any change to the frequency of serious assaults in residences. In some cities, there were reductions in residential burglary but little change in non-residential burglary. Thefts of motor vehicles decreased in some cities while there were diverging patterns of thefts from motor vehicles. These results are used to make suggestions for future research into the relationships between the coronavirus pandemic and different crimes.","tags":[],"title":"Initial evidence on the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  This post first appeared on the Social Research Association blog.\nUnderstanding if some event is associated with a change in the frequency of crime is a common question, both in practice and in research. A crime analyst might need to understand the impact of a change in tactics, a local journalist might want to check the truth of the mayor’s claims that her policies are working, while an academic might seek to find patterns associated with trends in socio-economic changes.\nOften, attempts to identify changes in crime frequency involve simply comparing the number of crimes this week/month/year to the number that occurred last week/month/year, or comparing this week, month etc to the same period last year. In recent weeks, we’ve seen these comparisons made to attempt to answer the topical question of how the COVID-19 pandemic is influencing crime. For example, police in San Jose told local news that violent crime had dropped 22% in the month to 18 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, while radio station WBUR reported that the frequency of shootings in Boston was broadly similar in March 2020 in comparison to the previous March. In Scotland, police reported overall violence fell in April 2020 compared to the year before, but fraud increased.\nBinary comparisons of one period to another are common, but can be seriously misleading. I’m going to outline five reasons why you should avoid binary comparisons, then suggest some alternative methods that can produce more-reliable results. All the examples in this article use open data from the Atlanta Police Department.\n1. Throwing away useful information The first problem with binary comparisons is that they typically ignore a great deal of other information about crime frequency. Take this chart of how the number of homicides in Atlanta changed from 2016 to 2017:\nAt first glance, the decrease of 25% in homicides between 2016 and 2017 looks impressive. Whatever the police, mayor, church group, etc is doing to reduce homicide must be very successful, right? But put in the context of previous years, the picture looks quite different:\nBy including all the available data on homicide frequency between 2010 and 2018, we can now see that actually the decrease from 2016 to 2017 was a return to the expected number of homicides after an exceptionally violent year (the 86 homicides in 2017 is almost identical to the median of 87 homicides per year between 2010 and 2018). Maybe whatever the police, mayor etc were doing in 2017 didn’t have the effect we first thought – our impressive-looking decrease might simply be regression to the mean. The 25% drop is probably real (although it’s always worth checking for changes in recording methods), but making a binary comparison threw out useful information that might have completely changed our conclusions about why it happened.\nWhenever you see a binary comparison, try asking yourself ‘yes, but what happened the year before?’ The 25% decrease in homicide between 2016 in 2017 could easily have been announced as a great success, but that year-on-year decrease could be part of any of these very-different scenarios – without more information, it’s impossible to know which is true.\n 2. Ignoring trends Another reason binary comparisons can be misleading is that they ignore any long-term trend in the data. For example, we can see that the general trend in Atlanta over the past decade has been for the number of burglaries to decrease (although there is also seasonal variation, which we’ll get back to):\n## Warning in mask$eval_all_filter(dots, env_filter): Incompatible methods ## (\u0026quot;\u0026gt;=.Date\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026gt;=.vctrs_vctr\u0026quot;) for \u0026quot;\u0026gt;=\u0026quot; ## Warning in mask$eval_all_filter(dots, env_filter): Incompatible methods ## (\u0026quot;\u0026lt;.Date\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt;.vctrs_vctr\u0026quot;) for \u0026quot;\u0026lt;\u0026quot; A researcher might attempt to understand the effect of some change or intervention (maybe a new anti-burglary initiative) by comparing the number of burglaries in a given month this year to the same month last year. This is very common, for example, in CompStat-style processes used to measure police performance. For example, New York City’s weekly CompStat report includes a comparison of crime frequency over the past 28 days with the same 28 days last year.\nBy ignoring pre-existing trends in crime, year-on-year comparisons such as this are very likely to produce misleading results. Over the period 2010–19, the average monthly year-on-year reduction in burglary in Atlanta was about 13%. A researcher doing a simple year-on-year comparison could easily conclude an anti-burglary intervention had been effective when it had actually made no difference at all. If the long-term trend had instead been for burglary to increase, a year-on-year comparison could easily have led to the (equally wrong) conclusion that a new program was making the problem worse.\n 3. Months are a terrible unit of analysis Months are a very common unit of analysis for measuring crime. For example, almost all the academic research on how much crime varies across seasons uses monthly crime counts. But months are a terrible unit of analysis for temporal data. The most obvious reason for this is that not all months are the same length. A recent CNN article on domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic noted:\n “[of] 20 large metropolitan police departments that provided data to CNN, nine saw double-digit percentage jumps in domestic violence cases or 911 calls in March, either compared to the previous year or to earlier months in 2020”\n but this ignores that March is 11% longer than February, so even if crime occurred at the same rate on every day in both months we’d expect a double-digit increase in crime in March (it also ignores that 11 departments did not see such an increase, but that’s a separate problem).\nThe second problem with measuring the frequency of crime by month is that not all months have the same number of each weekday, and many types of crime vary by day of the week. For example, aggravated assaults in Atlanta are concentrated at weekends:\nThe varying number of each weekday across months can easily generate changes in crime. October 2010 had 31 days, including five Saturdays and five Sundays, while November had 30 days including four Saturdays and four Sundays, which may go some way to explaining why aggravated assaults decreased by 15% from October to November that year.\nThe only good reason to use months as units of analysis is if you only have access to monthly data (e.g. if you’re using published monthly administrative data). If you have access to incident-level data, it is much better to use a unit of analysis that doesn’t have these problems, such as weeks or 28-day periods.\n 4. Seasons matter Many social phenomena, crime included, are more common at some times of year than others. Sticking with aggravated assaults, we can see that they tend to be more common in the summer than the winter (although there is a lot of noise):\nOver the decade 2010–19, on average the frequency of aggravated assault increased slightly (by about 1.7% per month) in the first half of the year and decreased slightly (by about 4.2% per month) in the second. This means that if we were comparing assaults in March to assaults in February (even if we corrected for the number of days in each month, and the different number of weekdays), we’d expect assaults to increase even if nothing had changed except the seasons.\n 5. Crime data are noisy Perhaps the most-important reason why comparing one year/month/week/day to the next is that crime data are typically quite noisy. Looking at larceny from vehicles in Atlanta, we’d expect a week-to-week change of at least 10% about every other week, at least 17% about once a month and at least 35% about once a year:\nNoise is likely to be higher when analysing shorter time periods, smaller geographic areas or more-serious crimes, because in each case the number of crimes is likely to be lower. Most police crime analysts will have a story of a local commander who came to them in a panic about a 100% week-on-week increase in a particular crime type, only to be reminded that the number of crimes had simply increased from one to two. Analysing small areas, short time periods and serious crimes might well be important, but it requires dealing with a greater degree of noise in the data.\n What to do instead Knowing the limitations of binary comparisons, some of the reported changes in crime during the coronavirus lockdown seem unremarkable. For example, the 10% year-on-year drop in crime in Chicago reported by Time and the 18% week-on-week decrease in burglaries and assaults in New York City reported by The Washington Post both seem like they could be entirely unrelated to the virus. There are plenty of theoretical reasons for thinking crime will change during the pandemic, but identifying changes reliably means using all the available information and taking into account trends, seasonality and noise.\nThere are several options for robustly identifying changes in crime associated with particular events or interventions. In some circumstances, you can run a randomised controlled trial, with people or places being allocated at random to either receive the intervention (be it an anti-violence initiative or new door locks) or not. Intervention areas can then be compared to non-intervention areas with a high degree of confidence that any systematic difference (other than the intervention) has been eliminated. Randomised trials have been used extensively in some areas, such as understanding the effectiveness of hotspot policing. However, randomised trials can only be run where you can choose where to target the intervention – you can’t randomise which cities are most affected by a global pandemic.\nWhen a randomised trial is impossible, you can use quasi-experimental approaches, such as difference-in-difference or regression discontinuity designs. These approaches involve comparing the people/places/groups that experienced a particular change to people/places/groups that didn’t experience the change but are otherwise similar to those people/places/groups that did.\nQuasi-experimental designs rely on the availability of a comparison group. If this is impossible, as in the case of trying to analyse the effect of a global phenomenon, alternative approaches are needed. Interrupted time-series designs use earlier data (from before whatever you’re interested in happened) as a comparison, but are only useful for measuring the impact of sudden changes.\nOne approach I used recently to understand how crime changed in large US cities in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic was to create a synthetic comparison group by using previous crime data to build a model that forecast how much crime would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic. The code to replicate that analysis is available online.\nSome of these methods might be beyond the capabilities of some people who need to work out if some event was associated with a change in crime. The increasing number of pracademics working in (for example) police forces means more agencies have the capability to carry out this sort of analysis. Many universities are also happy to partner with agencies for this type of work.\nBinary comparisons are easy to make, but there is little point if the results might be misleading. The extra work to produce reliable results is almost invariably worth it to avoid being misled, especially when those results are going to be used to make important decisions. Use the links here to identify a method that is going to work for your circumstances, or look for more detail in a textbook such as the free Causal Inference: the mixtape by Scott Cunningham.

As an example, we’ll use a file containing population estimates for each nation within the United Kingdom by five-year age groups.\nWhy do this? It might be tempting not to clean the data in R but instead simply open the relevant file in Excel and make the necessary changes there. This will work, but there are at least three reasons why cleaning the data in Excel is not necessarily a good idea.\n It’s harder to repeat the process. For example, if ONS updates the table (either because new data is available or to correct a problem) then you have to repeat the manual process in Excel. If you clean the data in R, typically all you have to do is run the script again. It’s harder to find mistakes. If you make a mistake while changing data in Excel but don’t notice until later (e.g. if your results don’t make sense) it will be difficult to track down exactly what happened. If you use a script to clean the data, you can go back and run it line-by-line to identify the problem. It’s harder for others to trust your work. If someone else wants to check your analysis (e.g. before taking action based on it), that’s more difficult if you have manipulated the data manually in ways the other person cannot see.   Before you start This tutorial assumes you have R installed and that you’re comfortable with the basics of using R to manipulate data. If you don’t have the tidyverse collection of packages installed already, run install.packages(\"tidyverse\") before continuing. It also a good idea to run this code from inside a project.\n Download the data Although ONS is relatively good at providing archive data, it’s good practice to always save an unamended copy of the raw data for any project just in case it later disappears from the source website.\n# download the data file download.file( url = \u0026quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland/mid20182019laboundaries/ukmidyearestimates20182019ladcodes.xls\u0026quot;, destfile = \u0026quot;ons_pop_data.xls\u0026quot; )  Load the data into R Since the data are in an Excel file, we can use the readxl package to read it into R2. ONS publishes data using a mixture of file formats, including both the pre-2007 Excel .xls file format and the current .xlsx format3. The read_excel() function can handle both .xls and .xlsx files, but can only load a single sheet from within an Excel workbook (i.e. file). We can use the excel_sheets() function to get the names of each sheet in the Excel file.\nlibrary(\u0026quot;readxl\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ── ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5 ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ✓ tibble 3.1.2 ✓ dplyr 1.0.7 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.3 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 1.4.0 ✓ forcats 0.5.1 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() excel_sheets(\u0026quot;ons_pop_data.xls\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;Contents \u0026quot; \u0026quot;Terms and conditions \u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;Notes and definitions\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Admin. geography hierarchy\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;MYE1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE2-All\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;MYE2 - Males\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE2 - Females\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;MYE3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE4 \u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;MYE 5\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE 6\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;Related publications\u0026quot; Note that some of the sheets have a space at the end of the name, which will be invisible when viewing the file in Excel but which we need to know about to specify the sheet name for read_excel().\nThe Contents sheet contains a short description of the data in each of the other sheets.

We can fix all of these either using the parameters of read_excel() or\nfunctions from the tidyverse packages.\nWe can exclude all the cells in the sheet except those containing data with the range = parameter of read_excel(). We can either specify the cell range manually (e.g. range = \"A5:H31\") or we can use one of the cell_* collection of helper functions from the cellranger package, which is loaded with readxl.\nWe can work out which cells we want to retain either by opening the file in Excel and noting which rows contain the data, or by running View(file_data) in R and then adjusting the value of range = in read_excel() until we are happy with the result.\nfile_data \u0026lt;- read_excel(\u0026quot;ons_pop_data.xls\u0026quot;, sheet = \u0026quot;MYE1\u0026quot;, range = cell_rows(5:31) ) file_data ## # A tibble: 26 x 8 ## `Country / Code` K02000001 K03000001 K04000001 E92000001 W92000004 S92000003 ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; UNITED KI… GREAT BR… ENGLAND … ENGLAND WALES SCOTLAND ## 2 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 3 All Persons 66435550 64553909 59115809 55977178 3138631 5438100 ## 4 Males 32790202 31864002 29215251 27667942 1547309 2648751 ## 5 Females 33645348 32689907 29900558 28309236 1591322 2789349 ## 6 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 7 Age Groups \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 8 0-4 3914028 3792292 3515430 3346727 168703 276862 ## 9 5-9 4138524 4009409 3708320 3523866 184454 301089 ## 10 10-14 3858894 3738572 3450782 3274119 176663 287790 ## # … with 16 more rows, and 1 more variable: N92000002 \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; This deals with the unwanted rows above and below the table, as well as the unwanted columns produced because of the feedback questionnaire.\nThe next problem is that the column names represent the GSS statistical codes for the different nations of the UK, rather than the names of the nations.

These are some of the issues I’ve come across and potential ways to deal with them.\n(The examples below all assume your data is in a data frame/tibble called data.)\nMissing values in the data Many ONS datasets have missing values, and some even have multiple values representing different reasons for the values being missing. For example, data for small geographic areas might be missing because the data could not be collected for a particular location or have been redacted to prevent disclosure of personal information.\nThe na = parameter of read_excel() can be used to specify values in the data that should be treated as missing. For example, if an ONS table uses a blank cell to represent data that could not be collected and ** to represent redacted data, read_excel(\"data.xlsx\", sheet = \"Sheet 1\", na = c(\"\", \"**\")) will ensure both values are represented by NA in R.\nIt isn’t possible to use drop_na() to remove empty rows if there are missing values in the data, because drop_na() removes rows that contain any missing values. Instead, you can use remove_empty() from the janitor package to remove rows or columns that are entirely empty. If there are rows that you want to remove from the data that contain some missing values and some values that are not missing, use filter() from dplyr based on the value of a specific column. For example, to remove rows with the value of population missing, use filter(data, !is.na(population)). To remove single rows manually by row number, use slice(), also from dplyr.\n Multiple tables in a single sheet Sometimes multiple related data tables are placed on a single Excel sheet. You can either import them separately and then combine the resulting datasets manually (e.g. with rbind()) or just treat the rows or columns between each table as clutter that can be removed using a combination of drop_na() and slice() as above. In the latter case, modify the range = argument of read_excel() so that the selected cells/rows/columns include all the tables.\n Category names or values with footnote markers If tables have multiple footnotes, some categories or values may end in a footnote marker (typically a number). To remove these, use str_remove() from stringr. For example, if the column place contains values with footnote markers, you can use mutate(data, place = str_remove(place, \"\\\\d+$\")) to remove them, where \\\\d+ is a regular expression that matches one or more numeric characters and $ matches only numeric characters at the end of the value of place. This only works for non-numeric values with numeric footnote markers, since the regular expression \\\\d+$ will match any sequence of numbers at the end of a cell.\n Dates and date ranges stored as text Since many ONS statistics are published for financial years, time periods are often stored as strings showing, for example, 2018-19. Converting these to dates helps with things like plotting values on an axis with date values or using the data in a time-series model.\nThe lubridate package is very useful for converting dates. You can either represent each date as a specific moment in time, or as an interval in time. For example, if a financial year is stored as 2018-19 in the year column, you can extract the specific moment the year started using mutate(year_beginning = ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4)), \"04\", \"01\")). In this code, str_sub(year, 0, 4) extracts the first four characters from the string 2018-19, paste() creates a single character value for 1 April in the given year (e.g. 2018 04 01) and ymd() converts that string into a date object.\nTo store a date as an interval, we extract both the date on which the year started and the date it ended. For example,\nmutate( data, year_interval = interval( ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4), \u0026quot;04\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;01\u0026quot;)), ymd(paste(str_sub(year, -2), \u0026quot;03\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;31\u0026quot;)) ) )  R session information The code in this tutorial was run in R with the following configuration:\n## R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) ## Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS Big Sur 11.1 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] magrittr_2.0.1 forcats_0.5.1 stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.7 ## [5] purrr_0.3.4 readr_1.4.0 tidyr_1.1.3 tibble_3.1.2 ## [9] ggplot2_3.3.5 tidyverse_1.3.1 readxl_1.3.1 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] tidyselect_1.1.1 xfun_0.24 bslib_0.2.5.1 haven_2.4.1 ## [5] colorspace_2.0-2 vctrs_0.3.8 generics_0.1.0 htmltools_0.5.1.1 ## [9] yaml_2.2.1 utf8_1.2.1 rlang_0.4.11 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [13] pillar_1.6.1 withr_2.4.2 glue_1.4.2 DBI_1.1.1 ## [17] dbplyr_2.1.1 modelr_0.1.8 lifecycle_1.0.0 munsell_0.5.0 ## [21] blogdown_1.4.1 gtable_0.3.0 cellranger_1.1.0 rvest_1.0.0 ## [25] evaluate_0.14 knitr_1.33 fansi_0.5.0 broom_0.7.8 ## [29] Rcpp_1.0.6 backports_1.2.1 scales_1.1.1 jsonlite_1.7.2 ## [33] fs_1.5.0 hms_1.1.0 digest_0.6.27 stringi_1.6.2 ## [37] bookdown_0.22 grid_4.1.0 cli_2.5.0 tools_4.1.0 ## [41] sass_0.4.0 crayon_1.4.1 pkgconfig_2.0.3 ellipsis_0.3.2 ## [45] xml2_1.3.2 reprex_2.0.0 lubridate_1.7.10 rstudioapi_0.13 ## [49] assertthat_0.2.1 rmarkdown_2.9 httr_1.4.2 R6_2.5.0 ## [53] compiler_4.1.0    ONS refers to this as ‘open data’, although (almost) all the products it produces are already open licensed under the Open Government Licence↩︎\n The readxl package is installed as part of the tidyverse but is not automatically loaded by library(\"tidyverse\").↩︎\n I have not been able to work out why some ONS files are in .xls format and some in .xlsx.↩︎\n   ","date":1567123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567123200,"objectID":"c04a8b56662656054edcf616f476b477","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/post/cleaning-ons-data/","publishdate":"2019-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cleaning-ons-data/","section":"post","summary":"UK Office for National Statistics data can be in formats that are hard to analyse.

This article introduces the Crime Open Database (CODE), a database of 16 million offenses from 10 of the largest United States cities over 11 years and more than 60 offense types. Open crime data were obtained from each city, having been published in multiple incompatible formats. The data were processed to harmonize geographic co-ordinates, dates and times, offense categories and location types, as well as adding census and other geographic identifiers.

Drawing conclusions from existing research is also complicated by data limitations and methodological differences. The present study sought to further research in this area using a novel open-data source.\nMethods: Police-recorded assault and personal robbery data from nine large US cities were used to test four hypotheses (derived from the routine activities approach) on spatio-temporal patterns of violence around schools. Multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo models were used to reflect the clustered structure of the data.\nResults: The presence of a public secondary (middle or high) school in a census block group was associated with higher daytime assault and robbery counts on weekdays when schools were in session but not on non-school weekdays, and the effect was larger for larger schools. No such relationships were found for elementary schools. However, there were variations between cities, in that there was no effect in one city and the effect sizes in other cities varied substantially.\nConclusions: The results were consistent with the routine activites approach, suggesting a role for middle and high schools in the distribution of neighbourhood violence. The differences between cities suggest that studying multiple cities is important in the investigation of crime and place, and that open data may provide a mechanism for overcoming the data-access difficulties that have previously limited multi-city studies of spatio-temporal variations in crime.

After controlling for other situational factors (such as public holidays and special events) and for the frequency of street crime, increasing temperatures are associated with small increases in police stops, while precipitation (rain and snow) is associated with substantial decreases.

In this paper, we draw on open-source data as denominators for calculating the risk of violent crime on London Underground. We argue that denominator choice can depend on the ease of availability, accuracy and applicability of the data required, and demonstrate how the choice of denominator significantly affects estimations of crime risk.

Useful CCTV was associated with significantly increased chances of crimes being solved for all crime types except drugs/weapons possession and fraud. Images were more likely to be available for more-serious crimes, and less likely to be available for cases occurring at unknown times or in certain types of locations.

In doing so, our aim is to discuss the practicalities of one important but often neglected source of data for research into child sexual exploitation: data that are routinely generated and collected by non- academic institutions in the course of their everyday business activities. There are considerable practical, logistical, and ethical benefits to using such secondary data. Child sexual exploitation is a highly sensitive and largely hidden issue that is notoriously difficult to research. Consequently, we benefitted greatly from the unobtrusive approach, increased reach, and cost- effectiveness that our research design permitted. Nonetheless, there can also be substantial challenges associated with working with secondary data not generated for research purposes. Among the key barriers we encountered were lack of clarity around key terms and fundamental parameters, missing data, and difficulties finding appropriate baselines against which to interpret our results. We will discuss approaches we took to mitigate these challenges and to ensure high-quality research outputs. Finally, we will reflect on some more general lessons both for the providers and for the users of non-research-oriented secondary data.

This thesis uses the paradigm of crime science to analyse the problem, focusing on thefts from the railway network in Great Britain. Two theoretical concepts are used: crime scripts and the routine-activities approach. Police-recorded crime and intelligence data are used to develop a crime script, which in turn is used to identify features of the problem a) analysis of which would potentially be useful to practitioners seeking to understand and prevent metal theft, and b) for which sufficient data are available to make analysis practical. Three such features are then analysed in more detail. First, spatial and temporal distributions of metal theft are analysed. Metal theft appears to differ from other types of acquisitive crime in ways potentially useful for prevention, for example in clustering outside (but close to) cities, and in exhibiting significant repeat victimisation over a longer period than found for other crimes. Second, the potential crime-prevention value of the market-reduction approach is analysed by testing for clusters of thefts close to the locations of scrap-metal dealers. Scrap-yard locations are found to be a significant predictor of local thefts, controlling for metal availability, area accessibility, and density of population and industry. Third, the involvement of organised crime groups (OCGs) in metal theft is tested. Due to the difficulty of defining and measuring organised crime, multiple approaches are used: all show OCG involvement to be rarer than official estimates previously suggested. The implications of these findings for practitioners are discussed. The thesis also considers the relevance of the results for the use of crime science and the analysis of OCGs.","tags":null,"title":"Using crime science for understanding and preventing theft of metal from the British railway network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Cockbain","MPJ Ashby","H Brayley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"42d0622615cbed380edc92ebbfa9309a","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/immaterial_boys/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/immaterial_boys/","section":"publication","summary":"Child sexual exploitation is increasingly recognized nationally and internationally as a pressing child protection, crime prevention, and public health issue. In the United Kingdom, for example, a recent series of high-profile cases has fueled pressure on policy makers and practitioners to improve responses. Yet, prevailing discourse, research, and interventions around child sexual exploitation have focused overwhelmingly on female victims. This study was designed to help redress fundamental knowledge gaps around boys affected by sexual exploitation. This was achieved through rigorous quantitative analysis of individual-level data for 9,042 users of child sexual exploitation services in the United Kingdom. One third of the sample were boys, and gender was associated with statistically significant differences on many variables. The results of this exploratory study highlight the need for further targeted research and more nuanced and inclusive counter-strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Immaterial boys?

Routine activities were operationalised through selecting events that potentially impacted on (a) the street population, (b) the frequency of crime or (c) the level of police activity. OLS regression results indicated that routine activity variables (e.g. day of the week, periods of high demand for police service) can explain a large proportion of the variance in search frequency throughout the year. A complex set of results emerged, revealing cross-national dissimilarities and the differential impact of certain activities (e.g. public holidays). Importantly, temporal frequencies in searches are not reducible to associations between searches and recorded street crime, nor changes in on-street population. Based on the routine activity approach, a theoretical police-action model is proposed.","tags":null,"title":"Routine activities and proactive police activity: a macro-scale analysis of police searches in London and New York City","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby","K J Bowers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443571200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443571200,"objectID":"d0f4f7e916e6317c40ebe0589c6d522a","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/scrap_metal_dealers/","publishdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scrap_metal_dealers/","section":"publication","summary":"Metal theft has become a substantial crime problem in many areas. In response, several countries have introduced legislation to regulate scrap-metal recycling yards. However, at present there is little evidence to support this use of the market reduction approach (MRA) in preventing metal theft. The present study sought to test the underlying assumption of the MRA that the presence of a market for stolen property (in this case provided by scrap yards) drives thefts in a local area. This study tested for a spatial association between the locations of scrap yards and those of metal thefts. The density of industry, local burglary rate and road-accessibility of an area were controlled for. Metal thefts from railway lines in England were shown to be significantly more common in areas with more scrap-metal yards, high road accessibility and high population density. The results support the use of the MRA in relation to metal theft.","tags":null,"title":"Concentrations of railway metal theft and the locations of scrap-metal dealers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441238400,"objectID":"d74229e9645da3920fe7732fa0527633","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/metal_theft_and_organised_crime/","publishdate":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/metal_theft_and_organised_crime/","section":"publication","summary":"Using the example of metal theft in the United Kingdom, this study used mixed methods to evaluate the accuracy of police estimates of the involvement of organized crime groups (OCGs) in crime.

Police.uk data are compared to police recorded data for one large metropolitan Police Force and spatial accuracy is quantified for four different levels of geography across five crime types. Hypotheses regarding systematic errors are tested using appropriate statistical approaches, including methods of maximum likelihood. Finally, a “best-fit” statistical model is presented to explain the error as well as to develop a model that can correct it.

Specifically, we analyze the relationship between the price of copper and the number of police recorded “live” copper cable thefts from the British railway network (2006 to 2012). Time-series analysis was performed using 76 months of data to determine the association between mean copper price and police recorded “live” copper cable theft. Two rival hypotheses, that changes in the theft of copper cabling reflect changes in the theft of railway property more generally (or the reporting thereof) or variations in the rate of unemployment, were also tested. We find support for the price–theft hypothesis: Changes in the price of copper were positively associated with variations in the volume of “live” copper cable theft. A downward trend in copper cable theft in recent years is also observed, although the mechanism/mechanisms underpinning this pattern is unclear. The theft of “live” copper cable is associated with fluctuations in copper price. As such, it differs substantially from the “crime drop” typically noted for most types of crime providing further support for the price–theft hypothesis.","tags":null,"title":"Copper cable theft: revisiting the price–theft hypothesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby","KJ Bowers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1369267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369267200,"objectID":"24114e08bdd9cde6b0d7eab78ea02862","permalink":"http://lesscrime.info/publication/aoristic_methods/","publishdate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aoristic_methods/","section":"publication","summary":"To test the accuracy of various methods previously proposed (and one new method) to estimate offence times where the actual time of the event is not known.
