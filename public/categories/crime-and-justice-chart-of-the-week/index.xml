      <description>


&lt;p&gt;The homicide-rate increase over the past five years hasn’t been unique to England and Wales, with murders also increasing in France, Germany and Sweden after continent-wide decreases since the 1990s. The UK-wide homicide rate remains about average for European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Police crackdowns catch few drink drivers</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Police routinely breathalyse drivers they suspect have been drinking, but also carry out an annual Christmas crackdown, breath-testing more than three times as many drivers in December as in other months. However, only about 1.6% of these extra tests catch a drink driver, compared to about 14% of routine tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/breath-tests_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;About 100 people a year die following contact with police in England and Wales. Public debate has often focused on deaths in custody or police shootings, but people are much more likely to die in collisions with police vehicles or in suicides following release from custody.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;About 1.4 million criminal cases were prosecuted in England and Wales last year. Motoring offences and minor non-violent offences such as TV licence evasion are the most commonly prosecuted, with many more cases in those categories dealt with by fixed penalties or other out-of-court disposals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: One in ten of us is on the National DNA Database</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;About 5.3 million people in England and Wales (about 10% of the population aged 10 or over) have their DNA stored on the National DNA Database, one of the largest DNA databases in the world. Police routinely collect DNA from arrested suspects, and it can be stored (often permanently) if they are convicted of almost any offence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/dna-database_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of people on the National DNA Database attempts to take
account of the presence of duplicate records on the database by reducing the
number of samples in each category by 14.1%, the estimated proportion of records
that are duplicates. See the data source for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the National DNA Database does not have an equivalent ethnicity category
to the ‘Mixed/multiple ethnic group’ categories in population data, people in
these groups have been categorised on this chart as being of Black, Asian or
other ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: More than 1,400 football arrests each season</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, more than 1,400 people have been arrested on average each season for football-related offences across the top five English divisions, with incidents reported at over 1,000 different matches. Most arrests are for violence, and about half are for offences outside the grounds themselves. More fans are arrested at away games, even though far fewer fans typically travel than attend home games. However, the rate of arrests at football matches overall is low, at about 3 arrests per 100,000 match spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/football-arrests_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Border Force is responsible for seizing drugs at ports, airports and international parcels depots. However, reports by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration suggest drug-detection efforts are hindered by understaffing, lack of training and focus on conducting passport checks on travellers. Most drug seizures are of small amounts: only 19% of seizures involve more than one kilogram of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/drug-seizures_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: When police use force, they rarely cause injury</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Police reported using force on over 300,000 occasions last year, or about 850 each day, with most incidents involving either handcuffing or other restraint. Almost all force used by police resulted in no injury to the person force was used against. When officers did injure people, the injuries were usually minor. However, since these are new statistics there is likely to be some under-reporting, especially of minor incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 69,000 adults (more than 95% of them men) are currently serving prison sentences, most of them for violent or sexual offences. However, over 10,000 adults are serving sentences for drug offences, more than for all types of theft combined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: In five years, crime-related demands on police have almost doubled</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;One way to understand crime-related demands on police forces is to track ‘crime pressure’, a measure of investigative workload representing the number of crimes reported to a force per officer, weighted according to Office for National Statistics estimates of the relative severity of different crimes. In the past five years, this measure has risen in every police force in England and Wales, and has doubled in many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/crime-pressure_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics&#34;&gt;Office for National Statistics, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;notes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics&#34;&gt;estimates of the severity of different types of police-recorded crime&lt;/a&gt;, derived from the average sentence imposed in court for each type of offence. In the same dataset, ONS publishes an overall estimate of the severity of crime per capita in each police force area. To convert this to an estimate of crime severity per officer (referred to above as &lt;em&gt;crime pressure&lt;/em&gt;), severity per capita was multiplied by police force area population&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then divided by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-workforce-england-and-wales&#34;&gt;number of full-time equivalent police officers in each force&lt;/a&gt;. Crime pressure is therefore defined as the severity of police-recorded crime per full-time equivalent officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the severity of different crimes are inherently limited, although they are likely to be more informative for some purposes than simply counting crimes (which implicitly assumes all crimes are of equal importance). For a further discussion of this, see &lt;a href=&#34;/publication/measuring_crime_harm/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparing methods for measuring crime harm/severity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Young offenders are more likely to re-offend than adults</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Most people convicted of a crime will not be convicted or cautioned for another offence within 12 months, although young offenders are more likely to offend again than adults. Most re-offending is by a small number of prolific offenders who frequently pass through the criminal justice system – more than 60% of people released from short prison sentences will reoffend within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/reoffending-rates_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Sentences for carrying a bladed or pointed article have become more severe for adults over the past decade, with 41% of men now going to prison on conviction. For younger offenders, the picture is different: half of girls and a third of boys caught with a knife receive no penalty – a proportion that is largely unchanged since 2008 – while fewer than one in ten receive a custodial sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart uses police-recorded homicide offences because that time series
extends further back in time than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2018#how-is-homicide-defined-and-measured&#34;&gt;Home Office Homicide Index&lt;/a&gt;, the main
alternative source of homicide data. The main disadvantage of this approach is
that crimes that are initially recorded homicides in police data but are
subsequently discovered not to be will not be included in the Homicide Index
data but will be included in police-recorded counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims of the Hillsborough disaster are recorded in ONS data as manslaughter
cases in the year ending March 2017 because that was when the revised inquest
verdicts were returned. However, in the chart above these cases are included in
the rate for 1989, when the deaths occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Police are arresting half as many people as a decade ago</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A combination of legal changes and decreases in many common types of crime, together with closures of custody suites due to budget cuts, mean police are making about 760,000 fewer arrests per year now, compared to a decade ago. The number of children arrested has decreased fastest, potentially driven by recognition of the negative consequences of criminalising young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online crime (including hacking, phishing and virus attacks) is now experienced by more businesses than any other type across sectors as varied as manufacturing and communications. But in the sectors most-likely to experience a crime (retail, accomodation and entertainment), traditional offences such as theft are still more likely. The data come from the government’s Commercial Victimisation Survey, which each year asks about crime against selected business types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every month, the Crime Survey for England and Wales asks a representative sample of adults about their perceptions of the criminal justice system. Across age, education, ethnic and employment groups, most people believe the system as a whole is fair, but only about half say it is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-reported drug use has fallen for most of the past 20 years according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, but in the past seven years the use of cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy has increased substantially, particularly among people aged 16–24. However, drug use is still lower now than it was at the turn of the millenium, with about 10% of adults saying they’ve used an illegal drug in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A combination of government-led changes to pay mean a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales is paid about £6,700 less now than they would have been a decade ago, once inflation is taken into account. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homicide (murder, manslaughter and infanticide) in England and Wales is rare, with about 12 homicides per million people last year, a similar rate to a decade ago. But homicide methods are changing: the rise in knife murders is well known, but there are other changes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/homicide-methods_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homicide counts here exclude victims of the Hillsborough disaster, who died
in 1989 but were recorded as manslaughter cases in 2017, and victims of the
Manchester Arena bombing in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 663,000 non-motoring offences for which people were sentenced in 2018, only about 11% resulted in a prison sentence. Some convictions, like rape and robbery, almost always result in a prison sentence (at least for adult offenders), while other offences very rarely result in imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are almost 22,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than in 2010, but numbers haven’t dropped equally across police forces. One force (Surrey) has the same number of officers now as 10 years ago, while officer numbers in forces like Humberside are increasing after steep cuts. But in almost half of forces, numbers are still falling despite a decade of often above-average cuts already.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 years’ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in 1987, only 25 people were a victim at least once in 2018. However, many of these crime types now appear to becoming slightly more common again.&lt;/p&gt;
