      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post first appeared on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crimcomm.net/post/how-to-stop-hiding-your-research&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#CrimComm Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a criminal-justice researcher and you’ve just published an article in a top journal. It was a lot of work: you spent months securing ethical approval, collecting data or negotiating access to secondary data, completing the analysis, writing up the results and responding to reviews. You are rightly proud of the result. But – by default and without meaning to – you have probably locked your paper away behind a journal paywall so that many potential readers simply can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researchers at universities in western countries typically have electronic access to journals, many others who could benefit from criminal-justice research do not. Universities in developing countries may have very few library resources, while access to journals in police and local-government agencies is typically extremely limited, meaning the increasing band of criminal-justice &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44293921&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pracademics&lt;/a&gt; (who want to make use of research and have the skills to do so) are often left in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of public access to criminal-justice research is particularly worrying because so much of it is relevant to practitioners and policy makers. Imagine a police captain who wants to know &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09518-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;what effects the introduction of body-worn cameras is likely to have&lt;/a&gt;, or who has to decide whether to authorize a &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.4073/csr.2013.5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a ‘scared straight’ program&lt;/a&gt; suggested by one of her officers. Not having access to good-quality research could easily lead to decisions that harm public safety or waste scarce resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;strong&gt;you almost certainly have the right to release a version of your paper online for anyone to read, completely free&lt;/strong&gt;. This is referred to as &lt;em&gt;self-archiving&lt;/em&gt; or as &lt;em&gt;green open access&lt;/em&gt;, to distinguish it from &lt;em&gt;gold open access&lt;/em&gt; in which authors pay an article processing charge (APC) to make the article free on the journal website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the main publishers of criminology journals allow authors to post the &lt;em&gt;pre-print&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;submitted&lt;/em&gt; version of an article (the version originally submitted to the journal) on authors&amp;rsquo; personal and university websites, as well as specialist websites known as pre-print servers. Most publishers also allow authors to post the &lt;em&gt;post-print&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;accepted&lt;/em&gt; version (the final version submitted to the journal after any revisions), although sometimes with more restrictions. As part of their open-access policies, publishers also do not consider self-archiving of pre- or post-prints as prior publication. There are other benefits to self-archiving, too: &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52646&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;releasing a pre-print is associated with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though authors can release their articles online, recent research shows &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wnq7h&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;only about a quarter of articles in criminology journals are open access&lt;/a&gt; (either green or gold). This means that in the past three years, over 9,000 criminology articles that could have been open to the public were instead locked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be worried about releasing your article publicly before it has been peer reviewed. What if you&amp;rsquo;ve made a mistake? You can decide not to post the submitted version online, choosing instead to post the accepted version once it is available. But doing this means your research stays hidden during the review and revision process. If a practitioner needs to make a decision now about a policy or practice, they may prefer to have access to your research (perhaps with a note explaining it has not yet been reviewed) rather than have to make the decision blind, only to see your research released a few months later when it no longer matters to them. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth remembering that the peer-review process is not perfect. Many mistakes (and worse) have been published despite being read by multiple reviewers, so authors should not treat peer review as the only determinant of research quality. I post both the submitted and accepted versions of my articles, trusting readers to understand that all research should be read critically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to discover your self-archiving rights under a particular journal policy is to search the &lt;a href=&#34;https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sherpa Romeo&lt;/a&gt; database, which summarizes policies from &lt;a href=&#34;https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/view/romeo_visualisations/1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more than 4,000 publishers&lt;/a&gt;. Take the journal &lt;a href=&#34;http://policing.oxfordjournals.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Policing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published by Oxford University Press. Searching on Sherpa Romeo &lt;a href=&#34;https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/publication/687&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../sherpa_romeo_screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot of the webpage https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/publication/687&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post the submitted (pre-print) version on your own website, an &amp;lsquo;institutional repository&amp;rsquo; (your university website) or a &amp;lsquo;subject repository&amp;rsquo; (a pre-print server),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post the accepted (post-print) version on your university website or a pre-print repository, but only 24 months after publication (known as an embargo period).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, once the article is published you must add a note to the pre-/post-print linking to the published version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the question of where to post your paper, remember the objective is to get your research into the hands of those who need it. The more widely you distribute your article, the easier it will be for people to find. I post my &lt;a href=&#34;http://lesscrime.info/publication/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;papers on my own website&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MPJAS93#tabsProfilePub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;institutional repository run by my university&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://socarxiv.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pre-print server called SocArXiv&lt;/a&gt; that hosts papers from across the social sciences. Other options include &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Academia.edu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ResearchGate&lt;/a&gt;, although there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://libraries.ou.edu/content/understanding-academiaedu-and-researchgate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reasons you might not want to use them&lt;/a&gt;. I use SocArXiv because it is indexed by search engines such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.co.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;. SocArXiv (and some other pre-print servers) also assign a &lt;a href=&#34;https://library.uic.edu/help/article/1966/what-is-a-doi-and-how-do-i-use-them-in-citations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;digital object identifier (DOI)&lt;/a&gt; to your article, making it easier for people to cite it even before the final version is published. Posting an article on a pre-print server is straightforward and usually takes only a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When posting your paper online, you will be asked to choose a license under which people can re-use it. By default, you own the copyright to any work you post online, but this may restrict others from using your paper by (for example) sending it to a mailing list or hosting a copy for students on their university online learning portal. You can make it easier for people to share your content with others by using an open license, which gives people re-use rights. For example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution License&lt;/a&gt; allows people to re-use your work for any purpose, as long as they cite you as the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self archiving can be useful even if you intend to eventually publish your article using gold open access. Gold open access makes it very easy for readers to find an article, but it is only available to authors (or institutions) who can afford the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/elsevier-academic-publishing-petition/427059/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;high prices of APCs&lt;/a&gt;. Gold open access also keeps research hidden throughout the peer-review and publishing process. If you plan to make your article gold open access by paying an APC, consider also posting the pre-print version of the article at the time you submit to the journal. If you are a research leader, be it a doctoral adviser or a head of department, you can also encourage self-archiving by establishing it as the norm among your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-access publishing isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to ensure your article has an impact among practitioners. You can also present your work at practitioner conferences, publish summaries of the results in practitioner-focused magazines or websites, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/ten-tips-tweeting-research-academic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;discuss your findings on social media&lt;/a&gt; or host a webinar. But self archiving to make your work available to practitioners and other readers who don&amp;rsquo;t have access to journal subscriptions is a great first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icjia.state.il.us/biographies/lily-gleicher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr Lily Gleicher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/peter-moskos&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof Peter Moskos&lt;/a&gt; for their comments on an earlier draft of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post first appeared on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://the-sra.org.uk/SRA/Blog/whyyoucantidentifychangesincrimebycomparingthismonthtolastmonth.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Version of this post on the SRA Blog&#34;&gt;Social Research Association blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding if some event is associated with a change in the frequency of crime is a common question, both in practice and in research. A crime analyst might need to understand the impact of a change in tactics, a local journalist might want to check the truth of the mayor’s claims that her policies are working, while an academic might seek to find patterns associated with trends in socio-economic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, attempts to identify changes in crime frequency involve simply comparing the number of crimes this week/month/year to the number that occurred last week/month/year, or comparing this week, month etc to the same period last year. In recent weeks, we’ve seen these comparisons made to attempt to answer the topical question of how the COVID-19 pandemic is influencing crime. For example, police in San Jose told local news that &lt;a href=&#34;https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-police-chief-talks-crime-trends-during-covid-19-shutdown/&#34; title=&#34;San Jose Police Chief talks crime trends during COVID-19 shutdown&#34;&gt;violent crime had dropped 22% in the month to 18 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, while radio station WBUR reported that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/04/17/boston-coronavirus-covid-19-crime-rate&#34; title=&#34;&amp;#39;This Is Too Much&amp;#39;: Crime Continues Despite Pandemic&#34;&gt;frequency of shootings in Boston was broadly similar in March 2020 in comparison to the previous March&lt;/a&gt;. In Scotland, police reported &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/violent-crime-falls-in-lockdown-but-police-reveal-fraud-is-up-as-crooks-exploit-coronavirus-crisis/&#34; title=&#34;Violent crime falls in lockdown but police reveal fraud is up as crooks exploit coronavirus crisis&#34;&gt;overall violence fell in April 2020 compared to the year before, but fraud increased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary comparisons of one period to another are common, but can be seriously misleading. I’m going to outline five reasons why you should avoid binary comparisons, then suggest some alternative methods that can produce more-reliable results. All the examples in this article use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlantapd.org/i-want-to/crime-data-downloads&#34;&gt;open data from the Atlanta Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;throwing-away-useful-information&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. Throwing away useful information&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem with binary comparisons is that they typically ignore a great deal of other information about crime frequency. Take this chart of how the number of homicides in Atlanta changed from 2016 to 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the decrease of 25% in homicides between 2016 and 2017 looks impressive. Whatever the police, mayor, church group, etc is doing to reduce homicide must be very successful, right? But put in the context of previous years, the picture looks quite different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By including all the available data on homicide frequency between 2010 and 2018, we can now see that actually the decrease from 2016 to 2017 was a return to the expected number of homicides after an exceptionally violent year (the 86 homicides in 2017 is almost identical to the median of 87 homicides per year between 2010 and 2018). Maybe whatever the police, mayor etc were doing in 2017 didn’t have the effect we first thought – our impressive-looking decrease might simply be &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyh299&#34; title=&#34;Regression to the mean: what it is and how to deal with it&#34;&gt;regression to the mean&lt;/a&gt;. The 25% drop is probably real (although it’s always worth checking for changes in recording methods), but making a binary comparison threw out useful information that might have completely changed our conclusions about why it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you see a binary comparison, try asking yourself ‘yes, but what happened the year before?’ The 25% decrease in homicide between 2016 in 2017 could easily have been announced as a great success, but that year-on-year decrease could be part of any of these very-different scenarios – without more information, it’s impossible to know which is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ignoring-trends&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Ignoring trends&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason binary comparisons can be misleading is that they ignore any long-term trend in the data. For example, we can see that the general trend in Atlanta over the past decade has been for the number of burglaries to decrease (although there is also seasonal variation, which we’ll get back to):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A researcher might attempt to understand the effect of some change or intervention (maybe a new anti-burglary initiative) by comparing the number of burglaries in a given month this year to the same month last year. This is very common, for example, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/the-crime-fighting-program-that-changed-new-york-forever.html&#34; title=&#34;New York magazine: The Controversial Crime-Fighting Program That Changed Big-City Policing Forever&#34;&gt;CompStat-style processes used to measure police performance&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/citywide-crime-stats.page&#34; title=&#34;NYPD: Citywide Crime Statistics&#34;&gt;New York City’s weekly CompStat report&lt;/a&gt; includes a comparison of crime frequency over the past 28 days with the same 28 days last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By ignoring pre-existing trends in crime, year-on-year comparisons such as this are very likely to produce misleading results. Over the period 2010–19, the average monthly year-on-year reduction in burglary in Atlanta was about 13%. A researcher doing a simple year-on-year comparison could easily conclude an anti-burglary intervention had been effective when it had actually made no difference at all. If the long-term trend had instead been for burglary to increase, a year-on-year comparison could easily have led to the (equally wrong) conclusion that a new program was making the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;months-are-a-terrible-unit-of-analysis&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. Months are a terrible unit of analysis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months are a very common unit of analysis for measuring crime. For example, almost all the academic research on how much crime varies across seasons uses monthly crime counts. But months are a terrible unit of analysis for temporal data. The most obvious reason for this is that not all months are the same length. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/04/us/domestic-violence-coronavirus-calls-cases-increase-invs/&#34; title=&#34;CNN: Some cities see jumps in domestic violence during the pandemic&#34;&gt;recent CNN article on domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[of] 20 large metropolitan police departments that provided data to CNN, nine saw double-digit percentage jumps in domestic violence cases or 911 calls in March, either compared to the previous year or to earlier months in 2020”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this ignores that March is 11% longer than February, so even if crime occurred at the same rate on every day in both months we’d expect a double-digit increase in crime in March (it also ignores that 11 departments did not see such an increase, but that’s a separate problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem with measuring the frequency of crime by month is that not all months have the same number of each weekday, and many types of crime vary by day of the week. For example, aggravated assaults in Atlanta are concentrated at weekends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The varying number of each weekday across months can easily generate changes in crime. October 2010 had 31 days, including five Saturdays and five Sundays, while November had 30 days including four Saturdays and four Sundays, which may go some way to explaining why aggravated assaults decreased by 15% from October to November that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good reason to use months as units of analysis is if you only have access to monthly data (e.g. if you’re using published monthly administrative data). If you have access to incident-level data, it is much better to use a unit of analysis that doesn’t have these problems, such as weeks or 28-day periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;seasons-matter&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Seasons matter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many social phenomena, crime included, are more common at some times of year than others. Sticking with aggravated assaults, we can see that they tend to be more common in the summer than the winter (although there is a lot of noise):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the decade 2010–19, on average the frequency of aggravated assault increased slightly (by about 1.7% per month) in the first half of the year and decreased slightly (by about 4.2% per month) in the second. This means that if we were comparing assaults in March to assaults in February (even if we corrected for the number of days in each month, and the different number of weekdays), we’d expect assaults to increase even if nothing had changed except the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;crime-data-are-noisy&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. Crime data are noisy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most-important reason why comparing one year/month/week/day to the next is that crime data are typically quite noisy. Looking at larceny from vehicles in Atlanta, we’d expect a week-to-week change of at least 10% about every other week, at least 17% about once a month and at least 35% about once a year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tracking-crime-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise is likely to be higher when analysing shorter time periods, smaller geographic areas or more-serious crimes, because in each case the number of crimes is likely to be lower. Most police crime analysts will have a story of a local commander who came to them in a panic about a 100% week-on-week increase in a particular crime type, only to be reminded that the number of crimes had simply increased from one to two. Analysing small areas, short time periods and serious crimes might well be important, but it requires dealing with a greater degree of noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-to-do-instead&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What to do instead&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the limitations of binary comparisons, some of the reported changes in crime during the coronavirus lockdown seem unremarkable. For example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://time.com/5819507/crime-drop-coronavirus/&#34; title=&#34;Time: Crime Rates Plummet Around the World as the Coronavirus Keeps People Inside&#34;&gt;10% year-on-year drop in crime in Chicago reported by &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/coronavirus-new-york-city-crime/2020/03/26/6a408e94-6f9a-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html&#34; title=&#34;The Washington Post: NYPD data shows sharp decline in crime rates&#34;&gt;18% week-on-week decrease in burglaries and assaults in New York City reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both seem like they could be entirely unrelated to the virus. There are plenty of theoretical reasons for thinking crime will change during the pandemic, but identifying changes reliably means using all the available information and taking into account trends, seasonality and noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several options for robustly identifying changes in crime associated with particular events or interventions. In some circumstances, you can run a randomised controlled trial, with people or places being allocated at random to either receive the intervention (be it an anti-violence initiative or new door locks) or not. Intervention areas can then be compared to non-intervention areas with a high degree of confidence that any systematic difference (other than the intervention) has been eliminated. Randomised trials have been used extensively in some areas, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jratcliffe.net/philadelphia-foot-patrol-experiment&#34; title=&#34;Jerry Ratcliffe: The Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment&#34;&gt;understanding the effectiveness of hotspot policing&lt;/a&gt;. However, randomised trials can only be run where you can choose where to target the intervention – you can’t randomise which cities are most affected by a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a randomised trial is impossible, you can use quasi-experimental approaches, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/causal-inference-using-difference-in-differences-causal-impact-and-synthetic-control-f8639c408268&#34;&gt;difference-in-difference&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://conjointly.com/kb/regression-discontinuity-design/&#34;&gt;regression discontinuity designs&lt;/a&gt;. These approaches involve comparing the people/places/groups that experienced a particular change to people/places/groups that didn’t experience the change but are otherwise similar to those people/places/groups that did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-experimental designs rely on the availability of a comparison group. If this is impossible, as in the case of trying to analyse the effect of a global phenomenon, alternative approaches are needed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.h2750&#34; title=&#34;British Medical Journal: Regression based quasi-experimental approach when randomisation is not an option: interrupted time series analysis&#34;&gt;Interrupted time-series designs&lt;/a&gt; use earlier data (from before whatever you’re interested in happened) as a comparison, but are only useful for measuring the impact of sudden changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach I used recently to understand &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ep87s&#34; title=&#34;Initial evidence on the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the United States&#34;&gt;how crime changed in large US cities in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; was to create a synthetic comparison group by using previous crime data to build a model that forecast how much crime would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mpjashby/covid19-crime/&#34; title=&#34;Initial evidence on COVID-19 and crime in the United States&#34;&gt;code to replicate that analysis is available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these methods might be beyond the capabilities of some people who need to work out if some event was associated with a change in crime. The increasing number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1093/police/paw029&#34; title=&#34;Unearthing Hidden Keys: Why Pracademics Are an Invaluable (If Underutilized) Resource in Policing Research&#34;&gt;pracademics&lt;/a&gt; working in (for example) police forces means more agencies have the capability to carry out this sort of analysis. Many universities are also happy to partner with agencies for this type of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary comparisons are easy to make, but there is little point if the results might be misleading. The extra work to produce reliable results is almost invariably worth it to avoid being misled, especially when those results are going to be used to make important decisions. Use the links here to identify a method that is going to work for your circumstances, or look for more detail in a textbook such as the free &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scunning.com/causalinference_norap.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Causal Inference: the mixtape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scunning.com/&#34; title=&#34;Scott Cunningham&amp;#39;s website&#34;&gt;Scott Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Some serious crime investigations are surprisingly quick: half of murder prosecutions involve a suspect being charged in five days or fewer. But for many serious crimes, justice is often slow: half of fraud prosecutions don’t conclude until almost two years after the crime occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Once police have enough evidence to prosecute an offender, they or prosecutors must decide whether to send the case to court or deal with it informally. For violent crimes, the likelihood of a case going to court varies substantially across police forces, with some prosecuting over 80% of cases and others diverting two thirds to other resolutions such as paying compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: No big changes in sentences after new police-assaults law</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;The government recently doubled the maximum sentence for assaulting a police officer to 12 months in prison, introducing a new offence of assaulting an emergency worker. So far, this change is associated with only small increases in sentences handed down in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/police-assaults_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../police-assaults.png&#34;&gt;larger image&lt;/a&gt;
| &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mpjashby/lesscrime.info/blob/master/content/post/police-assaults.Rmd&#34;&gt;annotated R code to produce this chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justice-system-statistics-quarterly-september-2019&#34;&gt;Ministry of Justice, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;notes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether there were any differences between imprisonment probability or sentence length before and after the new law was introduced, I ran separate ARIMA regression models (using the &lt;code&gt;auto.arima()&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;forecast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; R package) on the monthly probability of being imprisoned for assaulting police and on the average length of prison sentences. Each model included a variable that was set to false for months before the new law was introduced and true for months afterwards. If these variables were statistically significant (i.e. &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p &amp;lt; 0.05\)&lt;/span&gt;) we can say there is a difference in either imprisonment probability or imprisonment length after the law was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first model assessed whether the new law was associated with any change in the probability of being imprisoned on conviction for assaulting a police officer. This table shows that there was a small, but statistically significant, increase in the probability of being imprisoned after the new law came into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;variable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;estimate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;standard error&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;p value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;intercept&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.135&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.005&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;0.001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;after new law passed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.026&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.007&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;0.001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second model assessed whether the new law was associated with any change in the number of days imprisonment that people were sentenced to, if they were sent to prison for assaulting police. This table shows there was another small, but again statistically significant, increase in sentence length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;variable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;estimate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;standard error&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;p value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;intercept&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;60.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;1.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;0.001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;after new law passed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;9.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;2.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;0.001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these models are limited, because there are no comparison groups against which to compare the differences observed. This means it is not possible to estimate how likely it is that any differences are due to the new law or to other factors (such as long-term trends in sentencing practice) that were happening at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 10.9 million crimes which individual adults aged 16 years and over experienced in the past year, only 27% were reported to the authorities. Reporting rates vary substantially, with more-serious crimes more likely to be reported. Fraud makes up almost half of victim-based crime but is particularly unlikely to be reported, dragging down the overall average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police can search people they suspect of having prohibited items such as drugs or weapons. Since 2011, searches have decreased by 70%. Only 12% of searches lead to arrest, but this is increasing – total arrests from searches have decreased only 38% since 2011, suggesting police are getting better at targeting offenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police routinely breathalyse drivers they suspect have been drinking, but also carry out an annual Christmas crackdown, breath-testing more than three times as many drivers in December as in other months. However, only about 1.6% of these extra tests catch a drink driver, compared to about 14% of routine tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 100 people a year die following contact with police in England and Wales. Public debate has often focused on deaths in custody or police shootings, but people are much more likely to die in collisions with police vehicles or in suicides following release from custody.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;About 1.4 million criminal cases were prosecuted in England and Wales last year. Motoring offences and minor non-violent offences such as TV licence evasion are the most commonly prosecuted, with many more cases in those categories dealt with by fixed penalties or other out-of-court disposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5.3 million people in England and Wales (about 10% of the population aged 10 or over) have their DNA stored on the National DNA Database, one of the largest DNA databases in the world. Police routinely collect DNA from arrested suspects, and it can be stored (often permanently) if they are convicted of almost any offence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/dna-database_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of people on the National DNA Database attempts to take
account of the presence of duplicate records on the database by reducing the
number of samples in each category by 14.1%, the estimated proportion of records
that are duplicates. See the data source for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the National DNA Database does not have an equivalent ethnicity category
to the ‘Mixed/multiple ethnic group’ categories in population data, people in
these groups have been categorised on this chart as being of Black, Asian or
other ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, more than 1,400 people have been arrested on average each season for football-related offences across the top five English divisions, with incidents reported at over 1,000 different matches. Most arrests are for violence, and about half are for offences outside the grounds themselves. More fans are arrested at away games, even though far fewer fans typically travel than attend home games. However, the rate of arrests at football matches overall is low, at about 3 arrests per 100,000 match spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/football-arrests_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Border Force is responsible for seizing drugs at ports, airports and international parcels depots. However, reports by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration suggest drug-detection efforts are hindered by understaffing, lack of training and focus on conducting passport checks on travellers. Most drug seizures are of small amounts: only 19% of seizures involve more than one kilogram of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Police reported using force on over 300,000 occasions last year, or about 850 each day, with most incidents involving either handcuffing or other restraint. Almost all force used by police resulted in no injury to the person force was used against. When officers did injure people, the injuries were usually minor. However, since these are new statistics there is likely to be some under-reporting, especially of minor incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;One way to understand crime-related demands on police forces is to track ‘crime pressure’, a measure of investigative workload representing the number of crimes reported to a force per officer, weighted according to Office for National Statistics estimates of the relative severity of different crimes. In the past five years, this measure has risen in every police force in England and Wales, and has doubled in many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/crime-pressure_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics&#34;&gt;Office for National Statistics, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;notes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics&#34;&gt;estimates of the severity of different types of police-recorded crime&lt;/a&gt;, derived from the average sentence imposed in court for each type of offence. In the same dataset, ONS publishes an overall estimate of the severity of crime per capita in each police force area. To convert this to an estimate of crime severity per officer (referred to above as &lt;em&gt;crime pressure&lt;/em&gt;), severity per capita was multiplied by police force area population&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then divided by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-workforce-england-and-wales&#34;&gt;number of full-time equivalent police officers in each force&lt;/a&gt;. Crime pressure is therefore defined as the severity of police-recorded crime per full-time equivalent officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the severity of different crimes are inherently limited, although they are likely to be more informative for some purposes than simply counting crimes (which implicitly assumes all crimes are of equal importance). For a further discussion of this, see &lt;a href=&#34;/publication/measuring_crime_harm/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparing methods for measuring crime harm/severity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Most people convicted of a crime will not be convicted or cautioned for another offence within 12 months, although young offenders are more likely to offend again than adults. Most re-offending is by a small number of prolific offenders who frequently pass through the criminal justice system – more than 60% of people released from short prison sentences will reoffend within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentences for carrying a bladed or pointed article have become more severe for adults over the past decade, with 41% of men now going to prison on conviction. For younger offenders, the picture is different: half of girls and a third of boys caught with a knife receive no penalty – a proportion that is largely unchanged since 2008 – while fewer than one in ten receive a custodial sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart uses police-recorded homicide offences because that time series
extends further back in time than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2018#how-is-homicide-defined-and-measured&#34;&gt;Home Office Homicide Index&lt;/a&gt;, the main
alternative source of homicide data. The main disadvantage of this approach is
that crimes that are initially recorded homicides in police data but are
subsequently discovered not to be will not be included in the Homicide Index
data but will be included in police-recorded counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims of the Hillsborough disaster are recorded in ONS data as manslaughter
cases in the year ending March 2017 because that was when the revised inquest
verdicts were returned. However, in the chart above these cases are included in
the rate for 1989, when the deaths occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of legal changes and decreases in many common types of crime, together with closures of custody suites due to budget cuts, mean police are making about 760,000 fewer arrests per year now, compared to a decade ago. The number of children arrested has decreased fastest, potentially driven by recognition of the negative consequences of criminalising young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online crime (including hacking, phishing and virus attacks) is now experienced by more businesses than any other type across sectors as varied as manufacturing and communications. But in the sectors most-likely to experience a crime (retail, accomodation and entertainment), traditional offences such as theft are still more likely. The data come from the government’s Commercial Victimisation Survey, which each year asks about crime against selected business types.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Self-reported drug use has fallen for most of the past 20 years according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, but in the past seven years the use of cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy has increased substantially, particularly among people aged 16–24. However, drug use is still lower now than it was at the turn of the millenium, with about 10% of adults saying they’ve used an illegal drug in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of government-led changes to pay mean a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales is paid about £6,700 less now than they would have been a decade ago, once inflation is taken into account. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.&lt;/p&gt;

For 2019, second-quarter inflation estimates have been used.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Homicide (murder, manslaughter and infanticide) in England and Wales is rare, with about 12 homicides per million people last year, a similar rate to a decade ago. But homicide methods are changing: the rise in knife murders is well known, but there are other changes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/homicide-methods_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homicide counts here exclude victims of the Hillsborough disaster, who died
in 1989 but were recorded as manslaughter cases in 2017, and victims of the
Manchester Arena bombing in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 663,000 non-motoring offences for which people were sentenced in 2018, only about 11% resulted in a prison sentence. Some convictions, like rape and robbery, almost always result in a prison sentence (at least for adult offenders), while other offences very rarely result in imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tutorial: Cleaning UK Office for National Statistics data in R</title>
      <link>/post/cleaning-ons-data/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;TL; DR: &lt;a href=&#34;#complete&#34;&gt;skip to the complete script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK &lt;a href=&#34;https://ons.gov.uk/&#34;&gt;Office for National Statistics&lt;/a&gt; (ONS) publishes a
lot of quantitative information on all the topics you’d expect from a national
statistical office, but most of it is released in formats that need manual
cleaning before they can be used for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;ONS has started publishing some machine-readable data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but most products
its produces are Excel tables that are optimised for human reading by mimicking
the format of tables in the printed statistical reports that ONS produced for
decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial talks through how to clean a human-readable table produced by ONS
using the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; collection of packages, so the resulting &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html&#34;&gt;tidy
data&lt;/a&gt; can
be used for analysis. As an example, we’ll use a file containing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland&#34;&gt;population
estimates for each nation within the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;
by five-year age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-do-this&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why do this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be tempting not to clean the data in R but instead simply open the
relevant file in Excel and make the necessary changes there. This will work, but
there are at least three reasons why cleaning the data in Excel is not
necessarily a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s harder to repeat the process&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if ONS updates the
table (either because new data is available or to correct a problem) then
you have to repeat the manual process in Excel. If you clean the data in R,
typically all you have to do is run the script again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s harder to find mistakes&lt;/em&gt;. If you make a mistake while changing data in
Excel but don’t notice until later (e.g. if your results don’t make sense)
it will be difficult to track down exactly what happened. If you use a
script to clean the data, you can go back and run it line-by-line to
identify the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s harder for others to trust your work&lt;/em&gt;. If someone else wants to check
your analysis (e.g. before taking action based on it), that’s more difficult
if you have manipulated the data manually in ways the other person cannot
see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;before-you-start&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Before you start&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial assumes you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; installed and
that you’re comfortable with the basics of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497143/business-intelligence-beginner-s-guide-to-r-introduction.html&#34;&gt;using R to manipulate data&lt;/a&gt;.
If you don’t have the tidyverse collection of packages installed already, run
&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; before continuing. It also a good idea to run
this code from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/&#34;&gt;inside a project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;download&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Download the data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ONS is relatively good at providing archive data, it’s good practice to
always save an unamended copy of the raw data for any project just in case it
later disappears from the source website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# download the data file
download.file(
  url = &amp;quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland/mid20182019laboundaries/ukmidyearestimates20182019ladcodes.xls&amp;quot;,
  destfile = &amp;quot;ons_pop_data.xls&amp;quot;
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;load&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Load the data into R&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the data are in an Excel file, we can use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://readxl.tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;readxl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
package to read it into R&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ONS publishes data using a mixture of file formats,
including both the pre-2007 Excel &lt;code&gt;.xls&lt;/code&gt; file format and the current &lt;code&gt;.xlsx&lt;/code&gt;
format&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt; function can handle both &lt;code&gt;.xls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.xlsx&lt;/code&gt;
files, but can only load a single sheet from within an Excel workbook (i.e.
file). We can use the &lt;code&gt;excel_sheets()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the names of each sheet
in the Excel file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(&amp;quot;readxl&amp;quot;)
library(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that some of the sheets have a space at the end of the name, which will be
invisible when viewing the file in Excel but which we need to know about to
specify the sheet name for &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Contents&lt;/code&gt; sheet contains a short description of the data in each of the
other sheets. There are blank rows between every row in this table (an example
of how ONS optimises for human rather than computer readability), but we can
remove these rows using the &lt;code&gt;drop_na()&lt;/code&gt; function from the &lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop_na(read_excel(&amp;quot;ons_pop_data.xls&amp;quot;, sheet = &amp;quot;Contents &amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to use the data from the mid-2018 UK population summary, so we want
the &lt;code&gt;MYE1&lt;/code&gt; sheet. We can now use &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt; to load the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;file_data &amp;lt;- read_excel(&amp;quot;ons_pop_data.xls&amp;quot;, sheet = &amp;quot;MYE1&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;clean&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Clean the data&lt;/h1&gt;

## # … with 23 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t very useful. There are several problems we need to fix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the column names don’t reflect the data in each column,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all the columns have the type &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (character) even when the columns
contain numbers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are several blank or partially blank rows,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the feedback questionnaire in the top-left corner of the sheet means
&lt;code&gt;file_data&lt;/code&gt; contains an extra column,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a row containing a footnote,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data are in wide rather than long format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can fix all of these either using the parameters of &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;br /&gt;
functions from the tidyverse packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can exclude all the cells in the sheet except those containing data with the
&lt;code&gt;range =&lt;/code&gt; parameter of &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt;. We can either specify the cell range
manually (e.g. &lt;code&gt;range = &amp;quot;A5:H31&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) or we can use one of the &lt;code&gt;cell_*&lt;/code&gt; collection
of helper functions from the &lt;code&gt;cellranger&lt;/code&gt; package, which is loaded with
&lt;code&gt;readxl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can work out which cells we want to retain either by opening the file in
Excel and noting which rows contain the data, or by running &lt;code&gt;View(file_data)&lt;/code&gt; in

&lt;p&gt;This deals with the unwanted rows above and below the table, as well as the
unwanted columns produced because of the feedback questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem is that the column names represent the &lt;a href=&#34;https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106185615/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/index.html&#34;&gt;GSS statistical
codes&lt;/a&gt;
for the different nations of the UK, rather than the names of the nations. You
may prefer the codes, but we’ll assume that you want the names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use functions from the &lt;code&gt;magrittr&lt;/code&gt; package to work with individual values
in the data. All these functions are aliases for base R functions, but can be
easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

# remove the first row, which we no longer need, using slice() from dplyr

&lt;p&gt;We can convert the data from wide to long using &lt;code&gt;gather()&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt;
package. &lt;code&gt;gather()&lt;/code&gt; can be a slightly confusing function to use, but there are
some useful tutorials available by &lt;a href=&#34;https://garrettgman.github.io/tidying/#gather&#34;&gt;Garrett Grolemund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://uc-r.github.io/tidyr#gather--function&#34;&gt;UC Business Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading-and-gathering&#34;&gt;R for Data
Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;file_data &amp;lt;- gather(file_data, key = &amp;quot;geography&amp;quot;, value = &amp;quot;population&amp;quot;, -group)

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will neaten the data by converting the population variable to
numeric and the geography variable to title case (using a function from the
&lt;code&gt;stringr&lt;/code&gt; package).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;tips&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tips for other ONS tables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge number of ONS tables available, some having different formatting
issues from those mentioned above. These are some of the issues I’ve come across
and potential ways to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The examples below all assume your data is in a data frame/tibble called
&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;missing-values-in-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Missing values in the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ONS datasets have missing values, and some even have multiple
values representing different reasons for the values being missing. For example,
data for small geographic areas might be missing because the data could not be
collected for a particular location or have been redacted to prevent disclosure
of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;na =&lt;/code&gt; parameter of &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt; can be used to specify values in the
data that should be treated as missing. For example, if an ONS table uses a
blank cell to represent data that could not be collected and &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; to represent
redacted data, &lt;code&gt;read_excel(&amp;quot;data.xlsx&amp;quot;, sheet = &amp;quot;Sheet 1&amp;quot;, na = c(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;**&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;
will ensure both values are represented by &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t possible to use &lt;code&gt;drop_na()&lt;/code&gt; to remove empty rows if there are missing
values in the data, because &lt;code&gt;drop_na()&lt;/code&gt; removes rows that contain &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; missing
values. Instead, you can use &lt;code&gt;remove_empty()&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;janitor&lt;/code&gt; package to
remove rows or columns that are entirely empty. If there are rows that you want
to remove from the data that contain some missing values and some values that
are not missing, use &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; based on the value of a specific
column. For example, to remove rows with the value of &lt;code&gt;population&lt;/code&gt; missing,
use &lt;code&gt;filter(data, !is.na(population))&lt;/code&gt;. To remove single rows manually by row
number, use &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt;, also from &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;multiple-tables-in-a-single-sheet&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple tables in a single sheet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes multiple related data tables are placed on a single Excel sheet. You
can either import them separately and then combine the resulting datasets
manually (e.g. with &lt;code&gt;rbind()&lt;/code&gt;) or just treat the rows or columns between each
table as clutter that can be removed using a combination of &lt;code&gt;drop_na()&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; as above. In the latter case, modify the &lt;code&gt;range =&lt;/code&gt; argument of
&lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt; so that the selected cells/rows/columns include all the tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;category-names-or-values-with-footnote-markers&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Category names or values with footnote markers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If tables have multiple footnotes, some categories or values may end in a
footnote marker (typically a number). To remove these, use &lt;code&gt;str_remove()&lt;/code&gt; from
&lt;code&gt;stringr&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if the column &lt;code&gt;place&lt;/code&gt; contains values with footnote
markers, you can use &lt;code&gt;mutate(data, place = str_remove(place, &amp;quot;\\d+$&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt; to
remove them, where &lt;code&gt;\\d+&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html#matching-multiple-characters&#34;&gt;regular expression that matches one or more
numeric characters&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html#anchors&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; matches only numeric characters at the end of the
value&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code&gt;place&lt;/code&gt;. This only works for non-numeric values with numeric footnote
markers, since the regular expression &lt;code&gt;\\d+$&lt;/code&gt; will match any sequence of numbers
at the end of a cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;dates-and-date-ranges-stored-as-text&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dates and date ranges stored as text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since many ONS statistics are published for financial years, time periods are
often stored as strings showing, for example, &lt;code&gt;2018-19&lt;/code&gt;. Converting these to
dates helps with things like plotting values on an axis with date values or
using the data in a time-series model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;lubridate&lt;/code&gt; package is very useful for converting dates. You can either
represent each date as a specific moment in time, or as an interval in time.
For example, if a financial year is stored as &lt;code&gt;2018-19&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; column,
you can extract the specific moment the year started using
&lt;code&gt;mutate(year_beginning = ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4)), &amp;quot;04&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;01&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;. In this
code, &lt;code&gt;str_sub(year, 0, 4)&lt;/code&gt; extracts the first four characters from the string
&lt;code&gt;2018-19&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paste()&lt;/code&gt; creates a single character value for 1 April in the given
year (e.g. &lt;code&gt;2018 04 01&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;ymd()&lt;/code&gt; converts that string into a date object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To store a date as an interval, we extract both the date on which the year
started and the date it ended. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutate(
  data,
  year_interval = interval(
    ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4), &amp;quot;04&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;01&amp;quot;)),
    ymd(paste(str_sub(year, -2), &amp;quot;03&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;31&amp;quot;))
  )
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the 42 million adults in England and Wales aged between 16 and 74, 1.3 million have been sexually assaulted by a current or former partner, 4.3 million subjected to non-sexual assault and 2.3 million have been stalked. In every category, at least twice as many women as men have been victimised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Police cuts haven&#39;t hit everywhere equally</title>

&lt;p&gt;There are almost 22,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than in 2010, but numbers haven’t dropped equally across police forces. One force (Surrey) has the same number of officers now as 10 years ago, while officer numbers in forces like Humberside are increasing after steep cuts. But in almost half of forces, numbers are still falling despite a decade of often above-average cuts already.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Fewer people are victims of common crimes than 30 years&#39; ago</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 years’ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in 1987, only 25 people were a victim at least once in 2018. However, many of these crime types now appear to becoming slightly more common again.&lt;/p&gt;
